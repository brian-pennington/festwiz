I'm adding unofficial artists as I go but there won't be as much info for most of those, at least initially. Thanks for checking out this app. More and more unofficial shows will be added throughout the week.</p><p>-Brian</p>"

You can share ratings with friends or with your phone so that you can filter for the shows you want to find IRL. This app is a work in progress and I will be manually adding more unofficial artists and shows as I find them.</p><p>-Brian</p>"
