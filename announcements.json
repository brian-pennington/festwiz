  "body": "<p>Happy March! I added a few noteworthy new features this morning. The schedule mode now has a search filter similar to the rate mode, so you can search for a single performer you're trying to find or search by country of origin, search for Austin bands, or search by genre and subgenre, so you can see all the punk shows only, etc. Clicking on an artist name in the Rate mode now opens up a big window with all of their known shows, all the info you normally see on an artist card, and a full description. You can click on any of the shows and it will take you to that exact performance on the schedule page, and clicking on an artist in the schedule page will also have this functionality. Last of all, I did some work trying to make the Cloud mode be at least a little bit useful. You should now see a big smudge of shows with the artists you ranked highest at the top of the cloud, and mousing over any performance will bring it to the top. Probably more of a zeitgeisty thing than actually useful, but it's at least legible now.</p><p>-Brian</p>"

  "body": "<p>Just a couple days after cracking 900, we're now at over 1,000 artists in our database! Many new acts are getting added to the official website and many shows are getting added and updated. We will be attempting to track all of those changes. I've been squashing bugs in the schedule mode and trying to refine the interface so that it's ready for us all to use come March 12th. Also note I added an unofficial showcase that happens the weekend after the festival officially ends. Given this year's new format, there will probably be events before and after the fest worth checking out if you're in town, so I'm tracking those as well, and trying to indicate in the interface when we get into post-fest territory.</p><p>-Brian</p>"

    "body": "<p>Today we hit 900 artists in the database. Just a few days ago it was in the 700s. I've begun to go through the many, many unofficial showcases to put them into the system. I'm adding unofficial artists as I go but there won't be as much info for most of those, at least initially. Thanks for checking out this app. More and more unofficial shows will be added throughout the week.</p><p>-Brian</p>"

You can share ratings with friends or with your phone so that you can filter for the shows you want to find IRL. This app is a work in progress and I will be manually adding more unofficial artists and shows as I find them.</p><p>-Brian</p>"
