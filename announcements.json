Many new acts are getting added to the official website and many shows are getting added and updated. We will be attempting to track all of those changes. I've been squashing bugs in the schedule mode and trying to refine the interface so thatg it's ready for us all to use come March 12th. Also note I added an unofficial showcase that happens the weekend after the festival officially ends. Given this year's new format, there will probably be events before and after the fest worth checking out if you're in town, so I'm tracking those as well, and trying to indicate in the interface when we get into post-fest territory.</p><p>-Brian</p>"

I'm adding unofficial artists as I go but there won't be as much info for most of those, at least initially. Thanks for checking out this app. More and more unofficial shows will be added throughout the week.</p><p>-Brian</p>"

You can share ratings with friends or with your phone so that you can filter for the shows you want to find IRL. This app is a work in progress and I will be manually adding more unofficial artists and shows as I find them.</p><p>-Brian</p>"
