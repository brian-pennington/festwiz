With roots in Michoacán, Mexico, and a home base in Salinas, California, the band has been making waves since 2009, blending cumbia with rock, reggae, and hip-hop while bringing their dynamic live show to stages across the U.S., Mexico, and Colombia.\nThey gained wider attention with their 2019 debut Mujer, featuring “High Class” and “La Fuga,” and continued their momentum with releases like “Mata De Mota” featuring Tropa Magica, “El DUI” produced by Eduardo Arenas (Chicano Batman), and the fan favorite “Quemayama.” In 2024, they partnered with Grammy-nominated producer El Dusty for the remix album Reanimación and collaborated with Chuck Prophet on Wake The Dead, which hit #1 on the AMA/CDX Americana charts.\nNow entering their next chapter, ¿Qiensave? prepares to release their new album Así Las Cosas in summer 2026, led by the single “SED De Tu Amor,” as they continue pushing cumbia forward with a fresh, evolving sound.",

    "description": "Aaron Page is an emerging force in contemporary R&B whose music is as heartfelt as it is captivating. His journey began early, watching his older brother perform in a high school quartet and singing at talent shows during summers spent at his family’s camp. Early on, those cafeteria performances sparked a love for music that deepened with time. Aaron’s artistic foundation was laid at a music and arts academy in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he became the lead vocalist in a jazz ensemble and honed his understanding of song structure. It was there he realized music wasn’t just a passion – it was his purpose. Drawing inspiration from icons like Drake, Kanye West, John Mayer, Ryan Leslie, The Weeknd, and Michael Jackson, Aaron developed a sound that is moody, melodic, and emotionally raw. R&B runs deep in Aaron’s veins – it’s the core of his identity and the soundtrack of his upbringing. His lyrics are rooted in personal experiences and the world around him, unafraid to be vulnerable and honest. That sincerity resonates in tracks like “Pretty Girls Love R&B” – a breakout hit celebrating women and creating a vibe that’s both comforting and confident. Aaron has already left his mark on major stages nationwide, joining R&B heavyweights PARTYNEXTDOOR on the Sorry I’m Outside Tour and Bryson Tiller on the Back and Better Tour as an opening act. Whether on stage or in the studio, Aaron moves with love and intention, using music as both an escape and a celebration. Most recently, Aaron released his new EP, Before I Go – a sultry, rain-soaked sonic experience that offers a glimpse into his evolving style. With smooth melodies and infectious rhythms, the project is perfect for summer nights, late drives, and moments of reflection. It’s a boundary-pushing body of work that positions him as a distinctive voice in modern R&B. Now, he’s stepping boldly into the spotlight – bringing a fresh, emotionally rich perspective to R&B while honoring the genre’s timeless soul.",

    "description": "Ace Park is a native of the Southside of Houston. South Park, to be specific, where he gets the second part of his name from. He draws inspiration from Southern, Hip Hop greats such as Lil Wayne and Curren$y all the way to the likes of Kendrick Lamar coming out of the West Coast with a slight influence of traditional Hip Hop, boom-bap sound. Based off of the criteria of some of Ace’s favorite artist, the driving force for Ace to write and create music is making people feel good, promote positive messaging mixed with the reality of growing up in black communities. With that type of inspiration, Ace has built his image and musical style around being lyrically exceptional, while being one of the best dressed doing it. That same influence helped him build his brand and develop a line of merchandise that represents his ideology and where he comes from. I have continued to write and create music all year round with a concept of consistency therefore the listeners can join the journey of growth and development. In a city full of street warriors and homegrown gangsters, Ace Park is the street poet who gives an introspective perspective on Houston culture, lifestyle, and music.",

    "description": "Adult DVD, the Leeds based six piece have become known for their relentless output of euphoric hooks and grooves along with a relentless touring schedule that has taken them to Glastonbury, Greenman, End Of The Road and several European festivals this Summer.\nFormed by vocalist Harry Hanson and synth-player Greg Lonsdale, the project quickly expanded to a full band with Danny Blackburn (guitar/synth), Jake Williams (synth), Jonathan Newell (drums), and George Manson (bass). From the outset, their tongue-in-cheek lyrics, pulsating electronics, big choruses and unique production style (their releases are all self-produced) set them apart from the indie-rock landscape.\nFew songs capture the chaotic fun of Adult DVD more than their first release ‘Bill Murray’ - now a firm fan favourite and sing along moment at every festival set. First ‘proper’ single ‘Do Something’ from their 'Next Day Shipping' EP earned a spot on the BBC 6 Music B-list and support from BBC Radio 1, BBC Introducing and Radio X. Subsequent single ‘Because I Like It’ also landed onto the 6 Music B-list, and accompanying live performance from the BBC’s 6 Music festival.\nAdult DVD’s live shows are fast becoming legendary. From sold-out hometown headline gigs at Brudenell Social Club and Belgrave Music Hall (2 in the round shows in one day) to storming sets at The Great Escape, Deer Shed Festival, and Live at Leeds, their performances are high-energy and unmissable.\nWhether tapping into their love for chorus-centric indie or the influence of acid house floor fillers, DJing, or remixing their musical contemporaries their core appeal remains consistent: undeniable humour, bold danceable instrumentals and instantly memorable songwriting.\"",

    "description": "Formed in the lockdown winter of 2021, Agatha Is Dead! began as a post-punk experiment between longtime friends Lilly and Noah, who first made music together in their school days. Their shared love for Joy Division, The Cure, Molchat Doma, and Fontaines D.C. laid the foundation for their darkly urgent sound. With the addition of drummer Joey Ramone Hansen−bringing grunge and pop−punk bite−and Arthur on bass, the band played their first shows in 2022 and quickly carved out a place in Berlin's underground scene.\n\nThe band signed to Berlin label Duchess Box Records in May 2025 and will release their debut EP \"order\" in on 10th October.\n\nThe first singles drew attention from big online magazines such as Post-Punk.com and Diffus as well as major radio station airplay and big playlist support from Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThis September, the band will embark on their first-ever headline tour with shows in Berlin and Leipzig selling out in advance., marking a new chapter in their journey. Their Berlin show at Privatclub sold out an incredible five months in advance, underscoring the growing excitement surrounding the band.\n\nDrawing further inspiration from The Pretty Reckless, DIIV, Liily, and Bloc Party, Agatha Is Dead! have honed a sound that is heavy, hypnotic, and deeply emotional. With their debut EP Order on the horizon, the band are staking their claim in the next wave of alternative rock−grabbing hearts, shaking stages, and refusing to go unnoticed.",

Instead of conventional instruments, he creates music live from the body, the voice and everyday objects, working across genres from Brazilian downtempo to Techno. His shows and videos often break the fourth wall, inviting the audience to contribute sounds that become part of the piece.\n\nHis unique approach has drawn international attention: he has been featured in one of Beatport’s most viewed and commented posts and has performed at iconic clubs and festivals such as Fusion Festival (Germany), Sisyphos (Berlin), D-EDGE (Brazil) and Suma Han (Turkey). Supported by artists including Purple Disco Machine, Sam Divine and Mano Le Tough, he releases music on his label Mundo Afora Records and on respected imprints such as Black Book.\n\nHe has delivered four TEDx talks in three countries, played with Prince’s guitarist Miko Weaver, jammed with Bobby McFerrin, and had his productions remixed by Mad Professor.",

    "description": "AKA BK is an alternative indie project based in Los Angeles. With influences from bands like The Pixies, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and the Breeders, their live show plays like nerves exposed: charged, joyful and disarmingly human, turning their vulnerability into sharpened momentum. The band closes the distance between their fans, both literally and figuratively, inviting them to join in on their tongue-in-cheek moments of mushy playfulness and feverish moshing.\n\nThe foundation of AKA BK is built on long standing friendships, with BK (lead vocals) and Cecile Herledan (bassist) forming their first band at the age of 11 in Metro Detroit. The band is rounded out by fellow guitarists Julian Cullars and Sean Gunner Lee, who have been playing in LA bands since 2013.",

She began writing at 14, turning teenage thoughts into melodies and finding her voice in the quiet spaces between feeling and faith.\nRaised in the church, her sound was shaped by sacred harmonies and Sunday morning soul. What started in the choir grew into a deeper calling — to make music that heals, that lingers, that speaks when words alone fall short.\nBlending Neo Soul warmth with tender R&B vulnerability, ALANN doesn’t just sing — she pours. Every lyric is intentional. Every note carries emotion. Her music isn’t just heard… it’s felt.",

Cano has toured across the US, performing everything from intimate listening rooms to major festivals. He has shared the stage with artists such as Plain White T's, Gin Blossoms, Tyler Bryant and the Shakedown, Band of Heathens, and Chris Barron.

With huge momentum following their biggest London headliner yet at The Garage, following a sold out Oslo Hackney, four iconic sets at The Great Escape, 2000 Trees and Glastonbury. They have also toured with English Teacher, Lambrini Girls, The Libertines and Big Special.\n\nAlien Chicks' music is a testament to their diverse influences and fearless approach to genre.",

Her performances feel like ceremony: cinematic, high-voltage, and emotionally precise—where folklore meets the club, and tradition becomes future music.\n\nBack home, Alina built a major name fast: she performed on Kyiv’s main square for Independence Day in front of President Volodymyr Zelensky, and later that same night headlined the country’s biggest rave, Brave! Factory—proof of her rare ability to command both national stages and underground culture. She’s shared bills with top international acts, earned wide media attention, and continues to push Ukrainian sound into global pop and bass ecosystems.\n\nIn March she drops a deluxe release with 15 remix features—largely U.S. collaborators—bridging her world into American scenes. Now, she’s developing a new album and an expanded 2026–2027 performance program—built for discovery rooms and tastemaker festivals in the U.S. and beyond.",

    "description": "Alkyone is a Greek singer-songwriter hailing from the mountains of northern Greece. Born and raised in a small town surrounded by rivers and forests, she began her musical journey at the age of six, training as a classical pianist, before embracing songwriting as her true path.\nInfluenced by her father’s deep love for folk music, Alkyone began experimenting with traditional songs and textures, weaving a distinct folklore thread into her musical identity. Her sound blends indie songwriting, cinematic atmospheres, and folk elements from the Mediterranean and the Balkans. Singing in both English and Greek, her lyrics explore memory, growing up, and our evolving relationship with the world, while her concerts carry an intimate, personal, and emotionally charged atmosphere.\nShe has performed across Europe (Konzerthaus, Tonhalle, Carré, SNF, Onassis Foundation and others). In 2023, she collaborated with Vincent Moon and was featured on La Blogothèque. Her critically acclaimed debut album Exit Sign was released in 2023, while her second studio album, Small Philosophies, is expected in late spring 2026.\nHer stage name, Alkyone, is a tribute to a recurring dream in which she was a bird.",

Though raised on heartfelt sounds from Southern gospel, Alto’s sound pulses with a modern edge where soul meets synths. Drawing sonic comparisons to Sam Smith, Lenny Kravitz, & Usher, Alto’s smart, cheeky signature songwriting makes it unmistakably his own.\n\nHis latest album \"godspeed.\" caught the attention of Bob the Drag Queen, who later appeared on the project’s lead single, \"ride.\" The record marks a defining moment in Alto’s ascent blending bold, club-ready production with nostalgic Pop/R&B.\n\nAfter appearances on American Idol, MTV, and NPR, Alto continues to spark Atlanta’s underground scene with high-energy performances and a signature retro-futuristic aesthetic. A proud queer voice in pop, he celebrates freedom, reinvention, and the art of moving at your own speed.",

    "description": "Blending her sweet tones with beautifully constructed lyricism, Ama Louise brings her own style of modern day R&B. With a sound that resonates and chills, the rising North London singer songwriter has a distinctive sound that she’s bringing to the music scene. She draws on influences from the likes of Jazmine Sullivan and Destiny’s Child amongst others, to create a sound that is reflective of her talent and craft. Ama Louise’s sultry and buttery music is born out of a love for music from the late era of 90s R&B and when paired with her keen sense of emotion and melody gives rise to music that evokes feelings from the listener. Born to French and Ghanaian parents, Ama Louise is ready to take the music scene by storm bringing her own personal twist to what R&B music means to her.",

    "description": "“Rich with honesty and unbridled emotion” (Rolling Stone UK), Amie Blu feels perfectly at home in a new wave of alternative artists - Mk.gee, Dijon, SZA - whose casual handle on genre nonetheless feels completely rooted in classic, crafted songwriting. Born of French heritage in South East London, Amie cut her teeth in community projects growing up - ArtsTrain, Flames Collective – whilst developing her sound, and sense of self, across 2024 mixtape how we lose. Introspective but frank, songs like ‘everything about her’ showed a poetic brand of realism - and soulful, stop-you-in-your-tracks voice - way beyond Amie Blu’s years. Since then, Amie has opened for Joy Crookes, Jacob Banks, Faye Webster and sold-out her own headline dates as she builds up to 2025's debut album, when all is said and done. Featuring acclaimed singles like 'swimming in pity', 'shadow', and 'missing everything', it's a record drenched in feeling; startling explorations of love, loss, depression and human connection, but ultimately about the relationship with the self. Far from an exploration of endings, when all is said and done is the start of something truly special from Amie Blu.",

Amor’s music is best described as playful and eccentric, with an\nIcelandic sense of carelessness. Their sound is inspired by people who push\nthe boundaries of pop music, such as Björk, Jockstrap and Kate Bush.\nIn 2024, Amor released their debut EP, brb babe, earning them Reykjavik\nGrapevine’s ‘One to Watch’ and the Kraumur Awards. Since the release, they\nhave played at one of the biggest festivals in Iceland ‘Aldrei fór ég Suður’\nand collected over 30 performances around the country. This year they will\nbe playing at the iconic Iceland Airwaves off-venue showcase,\ndemonstrating that they are now ready to take their infectious beats abroad.",

    "description": "amri fuses her Indian roots into putting a spin on her much-loved Soul and R&B to create a fresh, new, jazzy, colourful sound. Branching into a range of sounds built in Carnatic melodies, amri balances relatable lyrics to a fun, fresh groove. Born and primarily brought up in London alongside Guernsey, she draws from these experiences in her writing. With so many inspirations she branches from, her soulful, sweet melodies will surely hold a piece of something you love and play over in your head!\n\nShe touches on her exposure in the world as a young woman of colour, translating this into getting you to feel, sing and move with her. Her debut EP ‘grooves in a SMILE’ invites you into her world to feel, sing and move with her. Having been interviewed on BBC Bristol’s Breakfast show, songs featured on BBC Introducing Radio and showcased in RESONATE and KICKDRUM magazines, amri has been gaining attention, and seems not to be slowing down.\nNow based in Bristol with her band, her blend of the smooth, sultry edges of jazz and soul, combined with brass and sitar, creates a unique fusion that’s not one to miss..",

    "description": "As a bassist, vocalist, and composer, my journey as a music creator has been shaped by my rich cultural heritage and passion for blending traditional jazz with contemporary influences. I grew up in the suburbs of Paris, born to parents of Senegalese, Gambian, and Malian descent. This background continues to inspire my artistry, which merges the sounds of jazz legends like Betty Carter and Wayne Shorter with the soulful rhythms of artists such as D’Angelo and Stevie Wonder.\n\nSince moving to London at 18 to study double bass at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, I have built a strong live track record, performing at renowned festivals and venues including the EFG London Jazz Festival, Jazz Café, Cheltenham Jazz Festival, We Out Here, Brick Lane Jazz Festival, and Pizza Express Soho. These experiences have been pivotal in building my fanbase and establishing my presence in the UK. Internationally I have performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival and countries around the world including France, Poland , South Korea and more.",

    "description": "Andy Arthur Smith is a singer, songwriter, and internet force of nature with 5.1M followers on TikTok (100M+ likes) and 1.1M on Instagram. Often described as “Jim Carrey meets Jacob Collier,” he combines elastic, absurd humor with mind-blowing musical ability by delivering powerhouse vocals, tight harmonies, and genre-jumping arrangements that feel as hilarious as they are impressive.\n\nWhat started as wildly creative short-form videos has grown into a full-fledged artist project. Andy’s debut EP Shortcut is a whirlwind blend of pop, jazz fusion, soul, and funk, showcasing both his technical chops and emotional depth. Whether he’s belting a hook, stacking harmonies, or slipping into a character mid-song, his performances feel unpredictable and electric. Previous collaborations include Vulfmon, GRAMMY-winning 8-Bit Big Band, KNOWER, and Straight No Chaser.",

The singer’s straightforward lack of pretension speaks from the vantage point of the outsider— and, often — the sounds of the unspoken.",

    "description": "With musical notes that span well beyond genres like bolero, psychedelic, and cumbia, The Animeros not only make their audience hit the dance floor, but they also invite their listeners and tastemakers alike to a glimpse of their rich cultural upbringing.\n\nThe group who is made up of Nick Tozzo (drummer and percussionist), Nicolas Sanchez (bassist), and Mauro Lopez (guitarist) craft a genre-blending sound that drifts between the lush jungles of Colombia, the palm-lined streets of 1960s coastal Mexico, and the dusty cantinas of West Texas.\n\nTheir journey took an unexpected turn when their music reached the ears of Dan Auerbach, (The Black Keys). Auerbach first heard them by chance, music floating from an open hotel window that stopped him in his tracks. They are now signed to Auerbach’s Easy Eye Sound label.\n\n“I feel like it's only a matter of time for these guys and for the music that they play. All they have to do is be themselves,” Auerbach said. “They're playing the kind of music that they can play forever until they're 100 years old because it's rooted in history, but it's very much in the present.”",

Known for her alt-leaning production, intoxicating pop melodies, and unflinching lyricism, Anna’s music vividly captures the turbulence, charm, and self-reflection of young adulthood. Recorded in Nashville, the album captures her personal evolution as she embraces a fresh, stripped-back sound, moving beyond the synth-heavy production that defined her debut album Everything Is Fine (I’m Only On Fire).",

In concert, they combine their unique brand of experimental rock with video and light installations triggered in real time by the band. While touring Canada, the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom with their telepathic audiovisual tempest, the outfit have shared the stage with the likes of ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Big Business, King Buffalo, and Duchess Says, also playing notable events such as Portals Festival, SXSW, and M for Montreal. Since 2013, they have released three full-length albums (Jinn, Trace, and Water, It Feels Like It’s Growing), two EPs (Figure and Ground and The Memory Empire), as well as a slew of singles.

Having recently completed their first UK headline tour in October 2025 to electric audiences in Glasgow, London, Bristol, Manchester, Leeds and Brighton and flooded with requests for a re-press of 'In Phases', a dedicated fanbase is making themselves known.",

    "description": "Babatunde Akinboboye is an internationally celebrated Nigerian-American baritone and the pioneering force behind Hip Hopera—a bold, genre-defying fusion of classical opera and hip-hop. With a powerful operatic voice and magnetic stage presence, Babatunde merges centuries-old vocal mastery with the cultural pulse of modern Black music, creating a sound that is as revolutionary as it is resonant.\nBorn of Nigerian descent and classically trained in Western opera, Babatunde’s unique cultural and musical background fuels his mission to make opera more accessible and culturally relevant. His breakout moment came in 2018 when he went viral for blending Rossini’s Largo al Factotum with Kendrick Lamar’s HUMBLE—a performance that amassed over 10 million views and earned global media coverage from TIME, MSN, and Classic FM.\n\nSince then, Babatunde has refined Hip Hopera into a distinct artistic movement, captivating audiences across the world through both digital platforms and live performance. With a loyal global following in the millions, he has become a cultural influencer who is using his voice—literally and figuratively—to expand the boundaries of what opera can be.\nHis classical résumé is just as compelling. He has performed lead roles with renowned companies such as Los Angeles Opera, Detroit Opera, and Utah Opera, including standout performances in The Central Park Five, Carmen, and Faust. A passionate advocate for African and African American composers, Babatunde brings visibility and vitality to voices often excluded from the classical canon.\n\nFollowing his successful City Winery tour, Babatunde is preparing to release his debut studio album and headline an international tour in 2026—a showcase of how Hip Hopera continues to evolve as both an art form and a cultural bridge.",

Produced by John Osborne (Brothers Osborne) with additional production from Greg Bieck (Little Big Town), the EP spotlights the duo’s powerful storytelling and unique swampgrass sound and consists of six tracks including their standout single, “Running Off The Angels,” which Billboard calls “An immensely promising release,” while All Country News declares, “a haunting, culturally charged ballad that cements their place as one of the genre’s most compelling new acts.” The Band Loula continues to garner widespread attention across the industry with their undeniable chemistry and near-blood harmonies, and recently made their Grand Ole Opry debut, for which they received a standing ovation. Powerful live performers, The Band Loula spent the summer 2025 with Dierks Bentley and Zach Top as part of Bentley’s Broken Branches Tour and has spent much of the past few years touring alongside artists such as Brothers Osborne, Ashley McBryde, Paul Cauthen, Elle King, Brent Cobb and Lukas Nelson.",

    "description": "“Dreamlike.” “Poetic.” “Beautiful.” — this is how audiences describe Bára Zmeková’s performances.\nThe moment she steps on stage, intimacy and imagination take over. A Prague-based singer, pianist and composer, she draws from the rich Czech singer-songwriter tradition while blending it with modern jazz and subtle electronics, creating music that feels both deeply rooted and strikingly contemporary.\nHer expression is civil yet emotionally powerful, inviting listeners into an inner world shaped by melody, atmosphere and nuance. Although she sings in Czech, language is never a barrier; the natural rhythm and softness of the language add a distinctive colour to her sound. Audiences across Europe and Japan consistently respond beyond words.\nHer trio moves between quiet minimalism and expressive intensity, built on strong melodies and precise interplay.\nThe critically acclaimed Lunaves established her as one of the distinctive voices of the contemporary Czech scene. In 2024 came the album Jediný na světě, followed by the single Jiné stromy, recorded with Norwegian tubist Daniel Herskedal.\nFollowing their second Japan tour in early 2026, the trio heads to SXSW directly from Tokyo.",

In the making of his latest body of work, the Austin-based artist/producer/multi-instrumentalist otherwise known as Roger Sellers found himself in even greater need of an outlet for his kinetic creative impulses, thanks to an intense convergence of events in his personal life: his father’s diagnosis with and eventual death from cancer, the end of a significant relationship, and an overwhelming struggle with depression and anxiety. Deeply informed by a deliberate transformation of his musical process, Bayonne’s third full-length Temporary Time ultimately makes for his most expansive work to date—an album of both painfully raw introspection and otherworldly beauty.",

    "description": "At just 23, Cardiff-born singer-songwriter Ben Ellis has become one of the UK’s most quietly magnetic new voices, blending intimate acoustic songwriting with the emotional depth of indie-pop. His upcoming third EP marks a pivotal moment both emotionally and musically. Written across two trips to Los Angeles in the aftermath of a breakup, the project explores the complexities of heartbreak, drifting between moments of clarity and confusion.\n\n“There was so much love still there,” Ellis says. “It’s crazy how art kind of comes from those moments.” Lead single “Where She Goes” emerged from a journal entry written the day after the breakup.\n\nFrom there, the EP grew into a layered and collaborative body of work. Tracks like “When It Ends” push into rock territory with biting guitars, while “Animal” leans into warm, ’70s-inspired folk textures reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac. Co-produced by Grammy-nominated Matt Rad and longtime collaborator James October, the sessions saw Ellis push himself creatively, from late-night listens to Damien Rice to recording live drums at LA’s legendary Studio 606.",

    "description": "Bershy is the pop persona of Midwest-born artist Brea Shay, a rising voice in queer pop. Emerging in 2020 with a trio of self-released demos, Bershy quickly caught the ear of her Cincinnati music community. She earned strong support from Inhailer Radio 90.9 WGUC and established herself as one of the city’s most promising new artists. Her initial breakout came in 2023 when TikTok tastemaker The Bun shared her dance-floor-ready love anthem \"Radio\", introducing her glittering sound to a global audience. Bershy dropped \"4U\"in March 2024, further refining her signature blend of glossy hooks and emotional vulnerability. Later that year, she relocated to Los Angeles to expand her creative horizons.\nIn 2025, \"Radio\" was featured in Episode 6 of the hit game Dispatch, taking the song, and Bershy, to new heights. With her heartfelt lyricism, infectious pop sensibility, and unapologetic queer identity, Bershy continues to carve her space in the modern pop landscape, one irresistible anthem at a time.",

    "description": "“I like that the better joy sound’s evolving; it’s what we do as people, so it’s only natural the sound grows with me” says Bria Keely, better known by her stage name - better joy. A vivid indie-pop guitar project backed by a band, better joy fuses sparky melodies with strong guitars and pulsating bass lines, coated in lyrics that delve deep into all things vulnerable. The upcoming EP ‘at dusk’, a sister EP to her debut ‘heading into blue’, reflects a moment in her life “where I just stopped trying to please anyone or caring whether the music I wrote ‘fit’ a mold. It’s not on anyone else to define what better joy is: it’s on me”.\n\nOriginally a singer-songwriter, Bria’s route into the indie guitar scene wasn’t conventional: ‘I’m not one of those musicians who grew up on The Cure or played in guitar bands when I was a teenager: I was listening to pop and that’s about it!’. A piano player and singer from a young age, it wasn’t until uni when she sang at the piano after a night out that her friends encouraged her to consider music as a career and she started writing her own music. “I was pretty bad at first, but I just kept at it. And now songwriting is something I can’t live without: for me, it’s therapy”. It was during this period that she started to fall in love with guitar bands, from Wunderhorse and Phoebe Bridgers to 80s guitar bands like The Cure and Mazzy Star, influences that have impacted the sonic development of better joy.\n\nWith her music described by BBC Radio 6 as bright, indie pop, better joy burst on the scene in 2024 with a string of singles and successful support tours; the start of 2025 saw a sell out of vinyls of her debut EP ‘heading into blue’ and a near sold out 10 city UK and EU debut headline tour in March 2025. And 2025 isn’t slowing down: she’s the main UK & EU support for Amy Macdonald in November and February 2026. “I still can’t get my head round it, to be honest. I was playing to a Glasgow audience of 100 people in March and in December I’ll be playing to over 13,000 at the Hydro Arena: it’s a bit bonkers”.\n\nProduced by Mike Hedges (The Cure, Manic Street Preachers, U2), mixed by Caesar Edmunds (Wet Leg, Beach House) and Robbie Nelson (Rolling Stones, Gregory Porter, Beck) and recorded at Chale Abbey Studios on the Isle of Wight, the 6-track EP, ‘at dusk’ is the antidote to the previously sunny introduction to better joy, ‘heading into blue’. Where naivety and openness shone through before, ‘at dusk’ is more contemplative and vulnerable. “It’s so normal to go headfirst into something, whether it be a relationship or a situation, with positivity and excitement, then for reality to leave you a bit jaded and changed” she explains. Whilst the bright and jangly guitars still shine through, it’s lyrics like ‘I never showed you the heavy metal in my bones’ and ‘watch me push against the clouds’ that clearly mark the tonal shift. But in true better joy fashion, the whole EP is uplifting and whilst it acts as a bookend to the debut EP, it leaves the listener hopeful for what music is coming next; the EP is “closing a chapter of my life where insecurity and self-doubt dominated my everyday experience. It’s me accepting the vulnerability that I felt and kind of promising that I’m gonna back myself from now on”.\n\n‘At dusk’ dances the indie-pop line with authenticity and joy, mixing dark and light tones and sounds, with a big injection of nostalgia. The first single, ‘this part of town’ is about embracing the unknown of relationships and acknowledging the fear that comes with vulnerability: “Eurgh, I hate being vulnerable, it’s really not my bag, but then I realised it’s such a universal feeling and sometimes you just have to accept it comes with being in unknown territory”. ‘steamroller’ is a dark and haunting anthem for anyone who has ever been trampled on by a ‘steamroller’. Bria recalls holding it back from her live set until her team encouraged her to try it, and the first time she did, she burst into tears - something that still happens now. ‘plugged in’ is a love song, for those people who go through their life believing they’re not made for love, until they meet their person and ‘i’m there’ is a thank you to the person who waited for you to come home to them. ‘big thief’ is about taking back your power, before the EP finishes with the beautiful ‘so long’, a goodbye to something that could have been.",

Vocalist Eric Braden conjures weirdo underdog characters, often in deadpan wit, while Alan Lauer plays scarily spring-loaded bass lines, Alex Riegelman scratches crazily on guitar, and ex-White Denim Jeff Olson pummels his drums with elegant aplomb. The result of this combination is a legendary live show, fueled by what has been called “climbing-up-the-rafters energy.”\n\nAfter being named Best Punk Band at the 43rd Austin Music Awards, Big Bill dropped their fourth full-length album, Sick Myth, November 2025 on Todo Records-- distilling the band's politically righteous, hook-laden approach down to its purest essence yet.",

    "description": "Big Fat Head is a byproduct of 21st century indulgence and a band consumed by sin. Based in Columbus, Ohio, this five-piece rock outfit has been categorized as “post-post-post punk” and “skuzz rock” by fans and enemies alike. First conceived by frontman Nate Wilder during a weekend visit in jail, a consistent live band was ultimately formed with partner Olivia Stefanoff and close friends Jordan Latas, Stanic Russ, and Felicity Gunn in the aftermath of Covid. Since 2021, Big Fat Head has maintained loyalty to their homegrown tape label and oft slept-on Ohio rock scene, self-released over 40 songs, played nearly 200 shows, with over 75 out of town. While sharing a scene in the shadow of Ohio legends like Devo, Breeders, Times New Viking, etc. with bands like Golomb, Villagerrr, Winston Hightower, DANA, & countless others, Big Fat Head carved their own niche-within-a-niche and found opportunities opening for national acts such as Being Dead, TAGABOW, Sweeping Promises, Wishy, Bnny, GOON, Speedy Ortiz, Lewsberg, & more. With two finished albums in their back pocket and no outside support to date, Big Fat Head embarks to Austin, Texas looking for love with their hearts on their sleeves.",

    "description": "“Whether I’m welcome or not” raps Bijaan on the opening bar of his debut single, “Jungle”, a line that immediately sets the tone for an artist unafraid to claim his space. Bijaan is a Calgary-based MC whose artistry bridges contents and cultures and has already captured the attention of major DSPs, key industry festivals, and fellow hip-hop artists and producers. Canadian born, with roots in East Africa and India, he brings a distinctly global perspective to hip-hop. Produced by the Polaris Prize-nominated hip-hop heavyweight Producer, Junia-T, “Jungle” is a bold exploration of identity, unapologetic self-belief, and belonging, anchored by Bijaan’s sharp lyricism and a unique, commanding delivery. From releasing mixtapes in high school, all the way to performing at major Canadian festivals and showcases such as NXNE, The JUNOs, Sled Island, Do It For The Culture, and Aurorapalooza, Bijaan has carved out his place as a rising voice in Canada’s hip-hop scene. Blending introspection with bravado, while taking inspiration from his varied cultural roots, he stands at the forefront of a new generation of artists redefining what it means to be global in hip-hop.",

    "description": "Taking over the sweaty New York venues and curbside congregations that came to be\nsynonymous with the name, Bloodsports is set to release their long awaited debut LP Anything\nCan Be A Hammer via brand new New York label Good English Records on October 17th.\nBloodsports has become an undeniable force amidst their latest line up, where members Sam\nMurphy (guitar/vox), Jeremy Mock (Guitar), Liv Eriksen (bass/vox) and Scott Hale (drums) find\nsolace in the capitulation of sonic strain; where angular sedition blends with economical\nmelodies that lighten the load of the self-destruction that these songs embrace. But as bold as\ntheir landscapes have been prior, Anything Can Be A Hammer finds the band embracing a more\ndynamic approach, maturing in their techniques as these songs brim over with subtle fixations –\nbalancing a steady pace of experimentation and curiosity that linger amongst the rhythmic blows\nand befuddling depths that the band confidently explores. Fragile, yet abundant, Bloodsports\nleans into that patience that plays to our own interior designs, where Murphy’s lyricism is a\nnotion of both what we know and what we think we know, as it all comes to the fore when our\nobsessions are at large. It’s an album that’s got blood in its veins and a finger on the pulse.",

    "description": "Conflict is interesting in art. It forces conversations, and asks questions that often still need to be answered. On “Black’s Law”, the third body of work from Irish quintet Bricknasty, some of society’s most complex topics are explored — religion, political disillusionment, nationalism, human mentality. For mercurial frontman/guitarist Fatboy and co, it’s less about seeing the light themselves — and more pointing others in the right direction.\n\nThe winding road to releasing the nine-track project has been arduous but enriching. After forming while studying at BIMM university in Dublin, the five initial members of the band, including the aforementioned masked maverick Fatboy, production whizz Cillian McCauley and drummer Korey Thomas, released their debut EP “INA CRUELER” via FAMM (Jorja Smith, Maverick Sabre) in June 2023, turning heads critically and garnering a loyal fan base with its idiosyncratic style and soulful tonal core.\n\nTheir inaugural project was a stinging reflection of Fatboy’s life in Ballymun, the troubled North Dublin estate where he grew up, and a vivid rumination of the familial turmoil and crippling addiction he endured during his young adulthood. But the band’s follow up mixtape a year later was “just songs,” the frontman says. That’s even what they named it — or “XONGZ አስቀያሚ ጡብ” to be precise.\n\nAlthough by no means a sub par end product, Bricknasty internally were never quite content with “XONGZ”; and the assembling of the mixtape proved a tumultuous time for McCauley and Fatboy’s personal and professional relationship, having fallen out in the process of making its predecessor “INA CRUELER”. “[XONGZ”] wasn't really a hard thing to pull off,” the latter says. “Me and Cillian, we felt like we didn't give the best account of ourselves. We didn't push ourselves as hard as we should have.”\n\nWhen it came to approaching this latest, third outing, the band hit the reset button. Both Fatboy and McCauley were working on music individually, but were struggling to progress beyond initial ideas. So the pair decided to escape from the drudgery of the everyday in order to gain some perspective, and booked a B&B in Ard Mhaca on the Irish border to tackle the starting foundations of the new work.\n\nThe process was reminiscent of the early days of their artistic partnership; a time prior to Bricknasty’s genesis when, having stumbled upon each other on Soundcloud as teens, they’d have stints making music in each other’s bedrooms until the early hours. The full circle return to this familiar DIY process rejuvenated the duo’s vision, and the roots of “Black’s Law” were born.\n\nThe entire project was made in six months — only six of those days were spent in a professional recording studio. Two of those months were spent on tour. “It was a huge amount of work that we had to get done in a tiny amount of time,” Fatboy recalls. “It was a bit too much for everyone to be honest.” With much to do, limited time and pressures high, the band hit a tipping point. Founding members — bassist Dara Abdurahman and keyboard/saxophonist Louis Younge bowed out of the collective, now replaced by Sam Healy and Chris LaMotte.\n\nDespite the difficult turn of events, the remaining Nasties plowed forward to finish “Black’s Law”, largely thanks to the symbiotic musical bond between Fatboy and McCauley. The producer holds the craft and patience to condense his frontman’s volatile creativity, chiseling his bursts of genius into a digestible palette. “I can spin my wheels until the cows come home,” Fatboy laughs. “Cillian definitely is like the Quincy Jones. He finds the right spot for the right thing. I'll come in aggressive from the out go and start dancing and moving around and just trying to find stuff.”\n\n“When it gets real sweaty,” McCauley takes over, “when it gets hot in the room, sometimes you just need to be able to see the take. That is the job.”\n\nHis counterpart interjects: “I’m in the heat of the chase. I have to make mistakes. I'm obligated to shit the bed.\n\nThe testing creative process was ultimately worth its endeavour. Rip-roaringly ambitious in its song structures, “Black’s Law” crams vast sonic and thematic themes into sharp, groove-laden, often luscious compositions that never end as they begin. The musical variety is wide-spanning — from the house-tinged varnish of “imperret illi deus \" to the wonderful Irish trad folk on “is é a locht a laghad”, and a hardcore edge on the backend of “go get that blade”. The EP plays out like a musical encyclopaedia, stunningly original with an almost competitive edge to its eclectic interior; a desire to “put the audience in the tumble-drier and stamp on their neck,” Fatboy jokes.\n\nThe frontman’s lyricism is instinctively written and delivered through pained gasps and vibrato’d whispers. His words put religion at the centre, the foundations of such narrative stemming from his own finding of God in the darkest of times. Stricken by drug and alcohol ad...",

    "description": "Brie Stoner is a creative code-switcher who makes music for those who've never belonged to just one place. Raised in Madrid, Spain, and now based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, she channels her multilingual life into indie dream-rock that feels both intimately personal and impossibly vast. Her upcoming LP \"Matador\" (releasing 2026) is a California-themed love letter, lush and cinematic, featuring orchestral arrangements by acclaimed arranger Kelly Pratt (St Vincent, Beck, and Beirut) and produced by David Vandervelde (Father John Misty). The album weaves strings, woodwinds, and horns through Stoner's poetic storytelling, creating an intimate portrait of artistic endurance, perseverance, motherhood, and the quiet act of creating beauty when the world feels uncertain. Her music has been featured by Ralph Lauren, Victoria's Secret, Orange is The New Black, The Affair, and Yellowjackets as well as other international TV and film campaigns. Featured in Spin, Atwood Magazine, and Magnet, Stoner's new album proves that the best art comes from moving between languages and landscapes.",

    "description": "Buddy Red is the Southern blues artist delivering the raw, cinematic sound of the Black American experience. A vocalist, guitarist, and preacher of truth, he stands where the cosmic mystique of Jimi Hendrix meets the uncompromising funk of James Brown and the psychedelic scope of Pink Floyd. A fixture of Atlanta's legendary Northside Tavern, Buddy is a vital voice recognized for his visceral guitar work and impassioned storytelling, captivating live and digital audiences alike.\n\nSince his breakout debut at SXSW, which included a featured set at The Shade Room's activation in 2023, his momentum is undeniable. He recently performed at the James Brown Estate for the Black Music Action Coalition’s Juneteenth celebration and shared the stage with Little Richard's original band at Tutti Frutti Music Festival. His new single, \"Sold His Soul,\" cemented his rise as a cinematic blues revivalist, with his cultural influence extending through partnerships with the Atlanta Hawks and BMW and a festival performance at Neon Prarie in Tulsa. Buddy Red is returning to SXSW as an essential force.",

Instead, there was raw honesty, a transparent openness that left no doubt in anyone's mind that this artist was the real deal.\n\nAnd that authenticity was reflected in every note, every lyric. It wasn't just about making a catchy tune or pandering to the latest trends. Byron was creating music that meant something, that spoke to the heart and soul.\n\nFrom the very beginning, he knew that he wanted his music to stand the test of time. He wanted it to be the kind of music that people would still be listening to decades from now, reminiscing about that moment when they first heard it and feeling all the same emotions rush back.\n\nAnd he's been succeeding. With every new release, he's taken his music to new heights, soaring higher and higher on the wings of his talent and passion.\n\nBut what's perhaps most remarkable is how new Byron is to the game. Despite that, his sound is like nothing else out there, a fresh take on the very soul of music that feels like it's been missing for far too long.",

Influenced by his artist grandparents, Terry and Jo Harvey Allen, Calder grew up surrounded by authentic artistic expression. Originally set on becoming a fly-fishing guide, he turned to songwriting during the 2020 pandemic, leading to his debut album The Game, produced by mentor Charlie Sexton.\nWith his new album, Fault Lines, recorded at Austin’s legendary Arlyn Studios with Sexton and Jacob Sciba, Calder delivers his most personal work yet—a cinematic exploration of love, loss, and self-discovery. Featuring contributions from Martie Maguire, Jon Randall, and Jack Ingram, the record captures the emotional depth and honesty at the heart of his songwriting.\nA commanding live performer, Calder has shared stages with Cody Jinks, Turnpike Troubadours, Miranda Lambert, and others, earning acclaim at festivals like Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo, and Two Step Inn. With Fault Lines, Calder Allen cements himself as a powerful new voice in Americana, blending Texas tradition with raw, introspective storytelling.",

    "description": "From the horror cabaret and glam-rock theatrics of his early career to the shadowy, neon-lit world of his current dark synth-pop, Austin-based performer Caleb De Casper has never stopped evolving. A classically trained pianist and vocalist, De Casper commands the stage with a sharpened, unmistakable intensity — trading in the avant-garde gowns and stilettos of the past for a bold, more masculine and unfiltered presence that puts the focus squarely on the music, the message, and the electricity of performance. His 2022 debut LP Femme Boy expanded his sonic world, weaving dancefloor heat, cinematic drama, and queer storytelling into a record that was equal parts brooding and explosive. That same year, the City of Austin proclaimed Caleb De Casper Day, recognizing his cultural impact. He went on to perform yearly at SXSW, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Utopia Fest, Houston’s Art Car Festival, Thin Line Fest, and multiple Pride celebrations, while continuously advocating for LGBTQIA rights at the Texas State Capitol and beyond. Now, with his forthcoming sophomore album Delirium, De Casper enters a new creative chapter — darker, dirtier, dance-driven, and poised for a breakthrough.",

    "description": "Camille Schmidt is a Brooklyn-based songwriter who writes with the kind of emotional clarity most people spend their lives avoiding. Her songs are known for their near mythic ability to turn confession into something communal.\n\nWith her debut album Nude #9 (2025), Schmidt renders revealing portraits of herself, friends, exes (all real names used), and strangers encountered in passing: a rambling OBGYN, a woman reading breakup texts on a plane, a Reiki healer who ends a session early after claiming Schmidt’s blue aura is overwhelming. Schmidt reminds us here that she is, at her core, a storyteller.\n\nSonically, Nude #9 abandons allegiance to genre. Moving beyond the folk-rooted approach of Good Person, Schmidt folds synthesizers, sequencers, and post-punk rhythms into her writing. The album appeared on multiple Best Albums of 2025 lists, with critics describing Schmidt as one of indie music’s “most important rising voices.” The cult-like devotion forming around her work has become a defining part of her momentum, increasingly evident in the way her songs translate from record to room. Schmidt is now at work on new music.",

Every bar is personal, every beat intentional. He doesn’t make music to impress—he makes it to connect, to challenge, to heal. Fully hands-on with his sound, visuals, and message, Canon creates from a place of truth, and invites his listeners to face theirs. This isn’t just music—it’s movement. Welcome to the journey.",

Cardinal Bloom's debut album “The Only Place I’ve Ever Known” released September of 2024 marking a new era of their music while still holding true to the sound they've carved as their own. Cardinal Bloom’s music encapsulates the nostalgic and bittersweet feeling of ‘better days,’ yet leaving you a notion there is still so much life ahead of us to be lived.\n\nCardinal Bloom is currently on tour throughout the U.S. and you can find tickets here on spotify or on their website www.cardinalbloom.com.\n \n“Everything they did worked together to absolutely nail that dusty Deseret sound—one that sits in between pop, rock, and folk.” -Zach Collier (Provo Music Magazine)\n \nTheir members include Joey St. John on guitar and vocals, Jacob Silvester on the bass and vocals, Josh Thomas on guitar, and Nate Adair on drums.",

Across the EP, bandleader Kylie Gaspard’s deeply direct vocal delivery cuts through dense riffs, grounding their songs with her gritty, emotional lyrics. Having recently shared stages with genre titans like Dinosaur Jr., Whirr, Nothing, and Narrow Head, Cashier are building a reputation for a massive sound that resonates far beyond their bayou home.",

    "description": "A reflection of the industrial grime and perpetual sunny glow of Los Angeles, Casket Cassette (Constant Williams) blends euphoria and melancholy in an expression of existential perseverance. Casket Cassette's depressingly danceable music takes a contemporary spin on the dark sounds of the 1980s Post-Punk and Darkwave movements, drawing further influence from New Wave, EBM, Synthpop and Indie/ Alternative to achieve this duality.\n\nThe project takes its name from a memory Williams has from childhood of his father recording a live song onto a cassette tape, then placing the tape into his grandfather's casket as it was being lowered into the ground. Williams' lyrics often reflect upon similarly somber themes such as mental health struggles, loss, heartbreak, addiction and recovery, while also offering glimmers of hope, humor and a general determination to overcome.\n\nWilliams lives in LA, and graduated in 2024 from the lowa Writers' Workshop with an MFA in poetry.",

    "description": "CDSM a.k.a. Celebrity Death Slot Machine is a “freakout post-punk group” (FLOOD Magazine) based in Atlanta, GA. Their stylish sonic onslaught is anchored around dancey rhythms, atypical synthesizer work, timely saxophone growls, as well as goth rock-esque melodies that serve to recount bizarre humor-laden tales from a derelict parallel universe. Since forming in 2021, the band has toured North America and Europe, sharing the stage with likes of The KVB, Bodega, Sheer Mag, Iceage, and Model/Actriz, while also taking part in events such as SXSW, Treefort Festival, Art Rock Festival, Hopscotch Festival, and M for Montreal. CDSM’s introductory EP, Hell Stairs (2022), was both glamorous and bleak, swanky and derelict, uplifting and crushing, described by the band as “hedonism clinking in your glass, change jingling in the pit of your chest.” Atlanta’s hot new commodity followed with a slew of music videos – “GOGO” (May 11th, 2023), “Entertainment” (2023), “DOM” (2023), and “SHADY” (2024) – amidst a stretch that saw them bring their sweaty live set to the very best underground venues the United States, Canada and Europe have to offer.",

    "description": "Raised by his grandparents in Greensburg, Kentucky, Chase McDaniel is one of Nashville’s most determined singer-songwriters — proof that grit and heart still matter. After graduating from the University of Louisville, he moved to Nashville to chase Country music dreams, only to be sidelined by the pandemic. Jobless and down to his last $12, he nearly gave up before a friend loaned him enough to stay afloat. McDaniel worked double shifts, slept four hours a night, and wrote with producer and best friend Jerry Jacobs whenever he could.\nThat relentless work ethic paid off. He hit #1 on the Billboard Country Digital Song Sales and iTunes Country charts with “Project” and reached #3 all-genre on iTunes with “Your Daughter.” Signed to Big Machine Records, McDaniel released his debut EP Blame It All On Country Music and has since taken his Country-rock sound and rich baritone to sold-out crowds nationwide. With “Burned Down Heaven” at Country radio and new music like “Risk It All,” McDaniel’s mission is simple: help others find the light.",

    "description": "“I do it with my heart on my sleeve,” Pierce sings on Blouse, the lead single and closing track of Chatterton’s latest EP, Tiny Empire. It’s the first release from the Oxnard, CA-based duo, consisting of Brock Pierce and Logan Scrivner, since 2024’s debut Fields of This, the album which earned them a slot on Pitchfork’s Best Rock Albums of 2024. The lyric embodies the new EP well—especially coming from a pair who often prefer to keep things abstract rather than confessional. Pierce may grumble that “everything has changed” on “Punching Bag,” yet Tiny Empire stands as a testament that sometimes change can work in your favor.",

    "description": "Chiara Savasta is a singer-songwriter from Montreal. Born in the suburbs of the city, onto a generation burdened by anxiety and desillusion, Chiara would sit in her room and romanticize her life through songwriting.\n\nThis way of escaping her teenage life became the foundation of her first project Summerhood. Released in 2022, Summerhood is Chiara’s own take on the coming-of-age experience, as she herself stumbles into adulthood.\n\nHer new project, brand new girl, brand new machine, captures the universal experience of feeling too much of everything at once, in our early twenties. This new chapter reveals a more grounded and mature soul, gradually finding her footing in the world. It’s through these ups and downs, always chasing the next dream, that Chiara became a brand new girl, like a brand new machine.",

Her 2022 EP, Luna, was produced by Walker Lukens and released via Park The Van Records, earning comparisons to artists like Santigold.\n\nA six-time official SXSW artist, she has opened for notable acts including The Wailers, Girl Talk, and Adrian Quesada of Black Pumas. Cleo became a member of the Recording Academy in 2022 and her 2023 single \"Weekend Warrior\" was in consideration for four Grammy nominations.\n\nHer music is often described as \"genre-bending,\" featuring register-spanning vocals and a strong visual aesthetic that includes ornamental fashion.

    "description": "Chuck Prophet’s streak of more than a dozen critically acclaimed solo records stretches all the way back to 1990, when the California native first shifted focus from his tenure with pioneering neo-psych band Green on Red to working under his own name. Since then, his songs have appeared in a slew of films and television shows, and his work has been covered by Bruce Springsteen, Solomon Burke, Heart, and a host of others. Rolling Stone dubbed him a “streetwise city kid with an eye for the country,” while Uncut proclaimed him a “renaissance-rocker,” and NPR declared that “no one can turn tales from the outer limits into catchy songs quite like Prophet does.”\n\nWake The Dead, Chuck Prophet’s extraordinary new album recorded with ¿Qiensave?, dives headfirst into the world of Cumbia music. The songs are intoxicatingly rhythmic, all but demanding you move your body while you listen. There are flashes of rock and roll, punk, surf, and soul, wrapped up in the rich legacy of a genre that traces its roots back hundreds of years and thousands of miles.",

    "description": "Tight, catchy, succinct, and loud are the best words for Commercial Breaks. Formed in 2025 by a gaggle of rockers and co-conspirators, the group features Lucas Martins, Trey Gutierrez and David Rawlinson, all of whom back Gus Baldwin as “The Sketch” as well as Doran Rawlinson, former drummer of Nolan Potter’s Nightmare Band. The members have performed around Austin for many years but never in such a hook-driven, song-forward capacity. Their debut record out Q4 2025 was recorded entirely at home to cassette tape to ensure absolute commercial viability, and their live shows pursue the title of either Austin’s “Loudest Pop Group” or “Pop-est Loud Group”.",

With punchy melodies and infectious hooks, congratulations deliver a mix of anthemic and experimental sounds fusing art-rock, garage, synth-pop and post-punk. The band’s lyrics explore themes of modern life, love, and self-discovery, delivered with a compelling honesty and emotion. congratulations’ fresh take on familiar sounds has earned them critical acclaim and a devoted and rapidly-growing fanbase, positioning them as one of the UK’s most exciting up-and-coming acts.\n\nSigned to Bella Union records, with the bands debut album \"Join Hands\" due for release on February 13th.\n\nHaving gained support previously from BBC Radio 1 and BBC 6Music including a live session for 6Music for Marc Riley. Previous supporters of congratulations include Iggy Pop, Craig Charles, Nick Grimshaw, Chris Hawkins and Jess Izzatt.",

    "description": "CorMae started as a social media ad and a dream and now has evolved into an up and coming punk and riot grrrl inspired band. The band started in February 2024, and has been steadily making its way into the Austin music scene ever since. Starting with a pop-forward garage rock EP, Cutie Core, released in April of 2025 and ending last year with a bang in October 2025 with the release of their more punk-forward EP “Hot Damn!” and an extra bonus punkified cover of Sheb Woolley’s “Purple People Eater,” CorMae are swiftly becoming an Austin Punk mainstay. The band are nominated by the Austin Chronicle for ATX’s 2025 Best Punk Band and you may also know them from opening shows for the likes of Of Montreal, Murder City Devils, and Pretty Girls Make Graves in 2025. CorMae’s songs are written about life, love, social, and economic struggles and their live show is aimed at commiserating on these issues with the audience. CorMae aims to build a community of friends and fans of all ages, creeds, races, and genders. After all, who doesn’t need a little cathartic shouting or a little dancing every once in a while?",

The band originally formed in San Luis Obispo, CA, and are currently based out of Los Angeles. The Dogs aim to push the boundaries of indie and garage rock with every release (whether it’d be glitchy electronics, gazey ambiance or stripped-back instrumentation). Unraveler, their latest EP, is Couch Dog’s most sonically diverse release to date. The project excels at retaining their classic and beloved sound from 2023’s “How to Ruin Your Life Fast”, distinguished by energetic guitar riffs, driving rhythms, and earnest lyricism, but elevates it with left field experimentation, song writing from different members and new textures.\n\nSince day one, they have placed an emphasis on putting on unforgettable live shows, helping audiences connect with their material deeply. Starting from sold-out house shows in their home town, to headlining a US tour, they always work on fostering a strong sense of community, belonging and freedom to go absolutely nuts in the mosh pit.",

Their lyrics tackle social and political unrest while offering moments of euphoric escape, and their chaotic, high-energy shows have built a devoted following through three sold-out UK tours, Glastonbury 2025, and European festival appearances.\n\nAfter earning critical acclaim for their debut album Plus Ultra (EMI, 2023) with support from BBC Radio 1, 6 Music, and Radio X, the band are now fully independent, embracing complete creative freedom. Their first independent single, Catherine Wheels, hit the cover of Spotify’s Rock List, and their upcoming release, Guns In Their Hands, is a defiant rallying cry about choice, resilience, and connection amid the chaos of the world.",

    "description": "Formed in the heart of Dallas but born on the highway, Cure for Paranoia came together during a “doomsday road trip” intended to be their last. Having recently been diagnosed with bipolar paranoid schizophrenia, frontman Cameron McCloud found clarity in a hot-boxed rental car; making music with collaborators Jay Analog and Tomahawk Jonez gave him peace of mind. “He said, ‘this is my cure for paranoia.’ Instantly, everyone’s eyes lit up,” a pivotal realization that cemented the group’s moniker. When the predicted earth-shattering meteor failed to hit, inspiration struck instead. As Jonez recalls, “On the way from Amarillo to Colorado Springs, like eight songs got written.”\n\nSince then, Cure for Paranoia has shared bills with icons ranging from George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic and Nas to Ludacris and Leon Bridges. Their resume includes stops at SXSW, Fortress Festival, and the NPR Tiny Desk Contest \"On The Road\" Tour, solidifying their status as festival favorites. While keen to distance themselves from standard regional production, they cultivated a signature \"Trippy Soul infused hip hop\" sound—a blend prioritized on their anchor project, the Work of A.R.T. EP.",

    "description": "With a voice that blends classic soul’s raw emotion with the edge of modern hip-hop, D’Chrome Foster is carving out a unique lane in today’s Hip-Hop/R&B scene. Raised in Brooklyn, NY, his sound reflects the spirit of ’90s hip-hop while exploring themes of love, resilience, and self-discovery.\n\nBorn Serge R. Thony, Foster honed his craft battling on New York’s Lower East Side at venues like The Pyramid’s “End of the Weak.” Inspired by icons such as Harry Belafonte and Michael Jackson, he developed a style that feels both timeless and deeply personal. His early theater work earned praise from The New York Times, calling him “young, cocky and ready to take over the world.”\n\nClassically trained at Esper Studio, he later earned his MFA from Rutgers University’s Mason Gross School of the Arts. Foster has appeared in off-Broadway productions including Ethel Sings, In Bed with Roy Cohn, and Kansas City Swing, along with television roles and national commercials.\n\nHis singles “January” and “L.O.V.E.” have gained thousands of streams and social media traction. With new releases Right Now and Gang, D’Chrome continues to evolve—delivering music rooted in authenticity, healing, and soul.",

    "description": "BIO\nDAIISTAR is an Alt-Indie band formed in Austin, Texas in the spring of 2020. The band takes their inspiration from the neo-psychedelic era of the 80s and 90s (The Jesus and Mary Chain, Spacemen 3, Primal Scream) and pulls it into the future with modulating synthesizers, heavy guitars, bouncing bass lines, and spiraling hooks, creating a narcotic blend of noise and melody. DAIISTAR recorded their first studio album produced by Alex Maas of The Black Angels and engineered by James Petralli of White Denim in the summer of 2021. The band signed to UK based label Fuzz Club Records with their debut album GOOD TIME released on September 8th 2023. The album is available on vinyl including a Levitation Exclusive Edition pressing, as well as CD and digital. DAIISTAR has performed at ACL, SXSW, Levitation Austin, Levitation France, Austin Psych Fest, Barcelona Psych Fest, KEXP, KUTX and has toured with The Black Angels, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and The Dandy Warhols.",

    "description": "Dallas Tenus is a four piece rock band from Raleigh, North Carolina that formed in 2022 and includes a collective of members who have traveled the world playing and performing music. The four established band members - Greg Clayton (Rhythm guitar and vocals), Billy Alphin (drums), Danny Kurtz (lead guitar) and David Wright (bass guitar) - have collectively played in various major label and national touring bands through the years including Whiskeytown, AntiSeen, Drivin’ n Cryin', Flat Duo Jets, Squirrel Nut Zippers, The Backsliders, Sarah Shook, Lustre, and The Rosebuds (to name a few). The new collective that is Dallas Tetnus is a musical combination of all of these influences, with a stage show that is packed with static energy and a pure rock showmanship that is one to be seen.\n\nThe band plays loud, short, catchy, 70s - inspired tunes with influences from The Ramones, The Stooges, and KISS. Their unique and original stage presence is hard to forget. Their shows have plenty of visual appeal and engagement with smoke and bubbles rolling through every set, with white suits and a pink lit backdrop to boot.\n\nThe debut album, Welcome To Dallas Tetnus, is available everywhere now.",

    "description": "David Huckfelt is a singer/ lyricist /folk-activist whose poetic sensibilities and songs of no-spiritual-surrender have earned him a cult following in the darker hollows far off the beaten path of the music business’s rushing roar. An Iowa native and former theology student, Huckfelt attended the prestigious Iowa Writers Workshop before dropping hold of academic and theoretical pursuits and turning his attention to songwriting and performing. With improvisational mastery and a stubborn insistence of remaining in the moment with his audience, Huckfelt’s folk shows have earned him a devoted following from small-town opera houses & theaters to national festival stages like Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, Edmonton and Calgary Folk Fests, and the legendary First Avenue mainroom. Sharing stages with artists as diverse as Mavis Staples, Bon Iver, Emmylou Harris, Arcade Fire, Calexico, Gregory Alan Isakov, Iris Dement & more, Huckfelt’s roots run deep as a folk singer steeped in the tradition of performing other artists’ songs. An early encounter and collaboration with legendary Native American poet John Trudell introduced Huckfelt as friend & ally to an array of Indigenous artists & activists including Keith Secola, Louise Erdrich, Winona LaDuke, Quiltman & more. He also served as musical director and performer at “Water Is Life” Music + Resistance Festival in Duluth, MN and his songs appear in the new AMC TV series “Dark Winds” produced by Robert Redford & George R.R. Martin. A founding frontman of Minneapolis indie-folk cult favorites The Pines,\nwith roots in the same Midwestern soil that produced legendary folk singers like John Prine and Greg Brown, David's new solo work preserves a rugged optimism that blasts through layers of darkness in real time with songs that speak volumes, soft & clear.",

Her career shifted after a viral performance caught the attention of Los CT Records, founded by Natanael Cano, leading to her signing as the label’s first female artist in its Mexican division through an Interscope partnership.\nShe has released singles including “Amor Perdido,” “Modelo,” “Entre la Maleza,” and “Butterfly,” collaborated with Becky G on “TODO,” and shared stages with Iván Cornejo. In 2025, she performed at the Selena Tribute Concert in Chicago. Her Interscope debut single, “SI DIOS LO QUERÍA,” was released in September 2025.

    "description": "Deloyd Elze, aka Jacob Henry Allen, is a genre-blending artist and poet from Jacksonville, Florida, whose music fuses traditional American songwriting with experimental and electronic textures. Over the past decade, Deloyd has tinkered with soundscapes that meld twangy guitars, lo-fi drums, dissonant synths and rich acoustic textures into ‘digital twang,’ a sound that seamlessly weaves between country, indie and electronic. The name Deloyd Elze honors his great-grandfather, a resilient man whose legacy of grit and defiance inspires his artistry. Like his namesake, Deloyd’s music is rooted in authenticity, reflecting the complexities of the human experience. Now based in Los Angeles, he’s creating music that speaks to life’s many layers, drawing from his family’s history and his own journey of self-discovery and survival.",

They’ve built a reputation for emotionally charged performances that feel expansive and immersive.\n\nWith no fixed front person, the band moves fluidly between roles. Mixed vocals, hip-hop drum beats, reverb-soaked guitars, and industrial undercurrents collide to create a powerful wall of sound that is dynamic, unpredictable and deeply human.\n\nTheir debut album NOWHERE continues to gather momentum, while their second full-length record 'Some Kind Of Pure State', arriving Spring 2026, marks a bold expansion in impact and atmosphere. Festival appearances include Fuzz Club and DesertFest Berlin (2026), with recent highlights at Fusion Festival (2024), Synästhesie (2025) and VOID (2025).\n\nAt SXSW, The Dharma Chain bring a live show that’s raw, hypnotic and built to pull you in.",

What started out as just a passion growing up in a quaint little mom-and-pop town suddenly turned into a lifestyle in 2013: “Debaron Hughes” became DJ4:12.\n\nHe’s come a long way since he moved to the city where the players play, finding his own groove, specializing in creating inimitable moments and experiences through his fingertips on a turntable.\n\nOver the past few years, he’s had the incredible opportunity to DJ for multiple artists, such as Lecrae in his “I’m Turnt” music video, Montell Fish, NF, KB, Tedashii, Canon, and Trip Lee (just to name a few).\n\nHe’s also been able to DJ at conferences like Destination Imagination, Catalyst, and Propel Women. When he’s not touring, he enjoys getting to DJ for Atlanta Track Club, America’s second-largest running club.\n\nHis most recent endeavors have found him DJing for multiple Fortune 500 companies, including Walmart, Pfizer, and Kraft Heinz, to name a few.",

    "description": "Hi Austin! I’m DJ Anupi, an Austin local with over 12 years in the music scene. My passion for DJing began in high school, driven by a desire to blend beats from the East and West and bring the best of both worlds together. Growing up listening to mostly Bollywood/South Asian music, I gravitated toward fusing global sounds with western styles. I started by creating mashups and quickly discovered my love for bringing people together and creating memories on the dance floor. What began as DJing high school dances soon evolved into spinning downtown on 6th Street, and eventually launching my own sound and events company. Through this journey, I’ve DJed everything from weddings and corporate events to large-scale public parties across Texas and the U.S. Running my events company gave me the opportunity to experience music from many cultures and styles around the world, further shaping my identity as a fusion DJ. Today, my style blends global rhythms and modern beats designed to move crowds and create memories. Recently, I’ve also stepped into music production, crafting remixes that I’m excited to start sharing on SoundCloud. Looking forward to SXSW 2026! See you on the dance floor!",

At just 14, he launched his journey into radio with KAZI 88.7, one of the longest running stations in Central Texas. There, he was apart of a teen-focused show that offered guidance for high school students navigating everyday challenges, transitioning into a solo radio personality. Along with up & coming local talent, he also interviewed major artist such as Slum Village, Trey Songz, Dorrough & Nivea to name a few. After college, Napalm came back to Austin ready to embrace the Hip Hop scene by linking up with ScoreMore Shows. There he learned the behind the scenes work for live music events and immersive experiences for consumers, such as The Illmore. Meeting artist like Kendrick Lamar, Curren$y and Big Sean evolved his passion into supporting local talent because he knew Austin had artist that could reach the same heights. Linking up with Austin pioneer J Soulja, The Smoke Out ATX (M.A.D.E Agency) & The Pre Roll ATX were born. The highest demanding Hip Hop platform in CTX, they advocate for local artist independence while providing a save space to network and build community.",

    "description": "Unpicking the thread that stitches together Don Glori’s music would be an impossible task. His records combine elements of Jazz, Funk, Soul, RnB and Samba, yet he doesn’t fit neatly into any of those genres. His live show is more jazz - punk - funk than anything. One thing is certain, there is an undeniable, joyful, spirit that permeates through his music.\n\nFollowing on from the success of his 2024 album ‘Don’t Forget to Have Fun’, Don Glori is back with his third offering, this time on Mr. Bongo - ‘Paper Can’t Wrap Fire’.\n“A kaleidoscopic genre-surfing odyssey that brings together the worlds of jazz, soul and funk. Feeling both contemporary and classic, familiar yet novel, it’s an assured third release that sees an artist in full flight, showcasing their creative prowess and the uniqueness of their musical voice.”",

But by now in 2025, the project has mutated into something brutal, noisy, honest, and unhinged. Motherhood, a slow unspooling of her faith, and the relentless static of American political and social climate have all pushed her toward the genesis of her own brand of dance punk - glitter grunge. So now, DOSSEY’s world hinges on distortion, punk rhythm and anthemic rock vocals influenced by The Clash, Nine Inch Nails and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.",

    "description": "Dramos is a New Jersey based DJ and producer redefining Latin club music through an East Coast lens. Rooted in Puerto Rican heritage, his sound blends Latin club rhythms, house structure, and global dance energy into a modern expression of diaspora identity. His performances are immersive and rhythm-driven, built as cultural experiences that connect tradition with forward-thinking electronic production.\nWorking at the intersection of ancestral rhythm and contemporary club architecture, Dramos moves fluidly between salsa-house hybrids, Latin tech grooves, percussive house, and broader Latin club influences. Live percussion textures, melodic phrasing drawn from classic Latin music, and driving low-end foundations sit at the core of his sound, creating records and sets that feel intentional, kinetic, and emotionally charged rather than trend-driven.\nHis releases have appeared on internationally respected labels including Dim Mak, Armada, Enhanced, and Stealth Records. With a growing catalog of original productions and hybrid Salsa-House and Latin club records, Dramos is carving out a distinct lane within global dance culture that centers identity, movement, and evolution.",

Newly signed to Big Loud Texas, the band made their label introduction with the release of “Take Too Much.” Their artistry is defined by lead singer Conner Arthur’s vocal growl and reminiscent of The Droptines most pointed influences like rock heroes Tom Petty and James McMurty. Working with lauded producer and Big Loud Texas co-founder and president of A&R Jon Randall, the gritty band is prepping new music entrenched in a southern vernacular – writing and performing the songs they want to hear most. Defined by a “beatnik-like itinerary of a lost soul’s activity” (Saving Country Music),",

    "description": "The Dub Gideon Band was founded in 2009 on the west side of San Antonio, Texas by a group of young men who were deeply inspired by Bob Marley and the spirit of RastafarI. After the release of their first EP in 2011, titled \"Underworld EP in Dub\", and the follow up EP \"Live in Love\" (2012), the band quickly became a staple at all Reggae events around Central Texas and established itself as a force to be recognized. Always rooted in the dub tradition, the band started to become a backing outfit for artists in the area who they felt needed a platform to perform their music. The band has backed amazing Texas, international, and Jamaican talent alike such as Likkle Shanx, Alika, Chris Boomer, Teki, Dre Z Melodi, Mister Kali, General Smiley (Michigan and Smiley), Admiral Tibet, Warrior king, Tristan Palma, Spiritual, Luciano, and so many more. Currently based in Austin, the band has re-emerged with a collection of some of Austin's finest Reggae musicians alongside original members from San Antonio. More than a band, Dub Gideon is a concept, and a force in the world of Reggae Music committed to upholding the true integrity of Roots and Culture Dub Music",

Frustration and aggression give way to a lighter antagonistic attitude from song to song or even section to section. The Dumes recorded their debut EP with Joe Chicarelli at Sunset Sound and worked up their latest material with Rob Schnapf at MANT. After being immersed in the LA scene for years, they’ve found a new home in Portland, Oregon. They are currently releasing songs from the new \"benched EP\" and have shared the stage with artists like The Warning, Sheryl Crow, Peter Frampton and toured supporting Louis Post of Veruca Salt.",

She’s earned recognition from platforms like On The Radar, landed a Range Rover brand partnership, performed with SoundCloud & opened up for Leon Thomas during Mutt's don't heal tour—signals that her world is expanding well beyond her local scene.\n\nReleased in Winter 2025, Where the Petals Fall feels like the next chapter: soft around the edges, heavy in meaning, and rooted in vulnerability, growth, and soul. It’s the kind of album that doesn’t chase a moment—it creates one",

    "description": "According to his mother, when E.M.E. (born Emmanuel Nwaneto) was baptized, the presiding reverend declared that the child would be a star. Two decades later, he's now fulfilling the reverend's prophecy as an up-and-coming Afrofusion artist based in Denver, Colorado. With over 1.5 million views on his videos and 2 million streams on Spotify and Apple Music, E.M.E is rapidly rising to meet his goal of bringing Afrobeats from Nigeria, to Colorado, and now to the world.\n\nE.M.E returned to music, recording and releasing a few hip-hop tracks. But it wasn't until he linked up with producers Mic Coats and F.L., of the legendary Denver-based label Hitsville. The trio immediately connected and got to work churning out music, ending up with a vault of over sixty songs in just a year. Several were dropped as experimental singles, like \"Drago,\" \"Yey Yey,\"\"Love Me Again\", \"One Day\", and \"Kolo\", as a way to test the waters and dial in E.M.E's sound. \"Got Me,\" his collaboration with Denver R&B royalty Danae Simone, was one of KS107.5's most played songs of 2024. His singles also started charting in Nigeria, climbing to Number 10 on the country's charts for all music genres.",

Since releasing his debut EP When I Was On Cloud 9 in 2021, which surpassed 700,000 Spotify streams, Elijah has emerged as one of Austin’s most compelling young voices.\n\nHe’s performed on some of the city’s biggest stages, including Blues On The Green 2025 for 20,000+ fans, the national anthem at Austin FC, and opening slots for Chaparelle, Next of Kin, Zach Person, and West 22nd. Festival highlights include Old Settler’s, UtopiaFest, Hot Summer Nights, and ACL Radio’s Drop-In, alongside headlining milestones like Meridian’s first sold-out show and a packed Stubb’s Indoors set following Dayglow.\n\nHis latest release, Moonboy (June 2025), showcases a bold evolution. The explosive single “Hide + Seek” contrasts with the aching title track, \"Moonboy\", exploring isolation, hope, and transformation. With vulnerable lyrics, dynamic shifts, and soulful delivery, Elijah is building a loyal audience and cementing his place as a rising Austin artist to watch.",

    "description": "Atlanta based musician, Elijah Johnston, will release a brand new album, Stupid Soul, via Strolling Bones Records on June 20, 2025.\n\nStupid Soul is either Elijah Johnston’s 4th record or his 7th, depending on who you ask, but possibly the first you’ve heard. The logical next step in a career of slow burns, Stupid Soul is neither a record of morose self-reflection nor a frenetic series of genre experiments, settling into a comfortable steady pace: a record built to fit like a glove.\n\nPerformed by a small team including Johnston’s brother, manager, and long-time producer, the record is full of small wonders and live band energy, the sound of four close-knit collaborators in pursuit of something timeless. 12-string acoustic guitars, vintage synthesizers, and a relentless belief in the guitar solo round out Johnston’s usual pop rock palate, and the team manages to make a coherent picture out of a mood board that takes just as many cues from Brian Wilson as it does from The Legend of Zelda.\n\nElijah began his career in the legendary musical community of Athens, and he was the winner of that city’s 2022 Vic Chesnutt Songwriter of the Year Award. Since then, he has toured nationally and shared stages with acts like Noah Gundersen, Susto, and Elf Power, establishing a name as a recognized songwriter with a potent live show to match.",

    "description": "EMI ANGELES is a trap artist born in Mexico City and raised in Nuevo León, whose music emerges from a deep creative and spiritual duality. His name comes from the abbreviation of José Emiliano Angeles Aguado and his strong connection to the Catholic faith, a constant pillar within his identity. His project is built around two alter egos: CRVZ, which embodies madness, contained rage, and raw energy, and Ángeles, his more human, sensitive, and everyday side. Influenced by Detroit trap, hood trap, and artists such as Playboi Carti, Ye, and Abhir, EMI ANGELES delivers an authentic and daring sound designed to send chills through the body, shake emotions, and leave a lasting imprint on the listener. His first encounter with music came at an early age after discovering Michael Jackson, leading him from dance to songwriting and eventually to the microphone. Key moments such as his EP ALTER/EGO and the loss of his best friend marked a turning point in his journey, solidifying his artistic commitment. Today, EMI ANGELES transforms the unknown into experience, creating music that connects with what many are afraid to name, aiming to leave a lasting legacy within the Mexican trap scene.",

She was shaped musically by both the grittiness of city and by Americana heroes like Kathleen Edwards and Alejandro Escovedo.\n\nIn 2021 Frembgen released her debut studio album with producer Hugh Pool at Excello Studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 2021. Irreverently titled It’s Me or the Dog, it garnered widespread critical praise, with New York Music Daily naming it “one of the best records of the year” and Glide Magazine calling it “a strong study in writing both melodies and powerful lyrics.”\n\nHer next full length album, Little Stranger, is due out in 2026.",

    "description": "The music of Endearments has always turned a mirror on the inner self, reflecting life’s deeply personal, often painful moments in the light of clarity and new resolve. Principal songwriter Kevin Marksson and his bandmates, guitarist Anjali Nair and drummer Will Haywood Smith, craft emotionally dense and instrumentally lush pop songs, viewed through the lens of contemporary, dreamy indie rock and embedded with a John Hughes-ian romanticism.\n\nDrawing on the emotive qualities of 80s synthpop and late-90s emo in equal measure, 'An Always Open Door', Endearments’ first full-length record, fine-tunes this heartfelt songcraft, widening the band’s influences and turning up the volume while maintaining the raw lyrical storytelling that’s made them a mainstay in Brooklyn’s highly competitive scene. The end result is a record that reevaluates the past, foregrounding emotional truths through performances that are as kinetic as they are introspective. Produced by Abe Seiferth, the album blends dreamy and down-to-earth influences into a vibrant, varied, and dynamic image of the band’s inner world.\n\nAn Always Open Door will be available on March 6, 2026, via Trash Casual.",

    "description": "Enfants is a four-piece Japanese alternative rock band formed in 2022. Their name, pronounced \"En-fant,\" means \"children\" in French.\n\nThe band’s sound is a raw fusion of primal impulse and liberation, woven with the delicate nuances of Japanese lyrics. They gained momentum in 2023 when their track \"Play\" went viral. By early 2025, they were named a \"Top 10 Artist\" by industry pros on national TV, solidifying their place on Japan's viral charts.\n\nA powerhouse live act, Enfants has performed at major festivals like SUMMER SONIC 2024 and expanded internationally to Taiwan and Korea. Following their 2025 SXSW debut, they return to Austin in March 2026, fresh off the release of their new album Bedford Hedgehog (Feb 4) and a sold-out 1,500-capacity show in Tokyo.\n\nFrontman Dai Matsumoto’s songwriting is a defiant resistance against a society that dismisses emotional vulnerability, transforming \"weakness\" into strength. On stage, their performance is a visceral explosion of pure emotion. Enfants creates anthems for those struggling to find their place, serving as a \"quiet revolution\" for a generation forced to suppress their feelings.",

    "description": "The Eric Hisaw Band is a roots rock’n’roll trio based in Austin, Tx. The 2025 Flak Records release Otra Vez draws on influences ranging from John Lee Hooker, Jerry Lee Lewis & Link Wray filtered through a 1960’s Nuggets era garage rock sensibility. The bulk of the material was developed while Hisaw was laid up with a gunshot wound from a wayward bullet that entered his family’s southeast Austin home. Using small Fender amps, lots of tremolo, Silvertone & telecaster guitars, Hisaw, drummer Shawn Peters and bassist Ron McRae create a rough and tumble, driving sound to support Hisaw’s literate tales of outsiders living on the fringes of the American dream. Since McRae’s departure to Eugene, OR, bass duties have been filled by Jimmy Pettit (of the great 80’s Joe Ely Band) who has brought his own unique raw power rock’n’roll spirit to the band’s live show. Look for lots of regional shows & new music from the band coming soon.",

    "description": "FAMA is the musical project of brothers Facundo and Mateo, born in Peru with Argentine roots. Their name [Fa + Ma] reflects a lifelong bond shaped by music, art, and shared creative curiosity. Blending intimate acoustic pop with touches of country, funk, and organic textures. Their first-ever release surpassed 100K views on YouTube, and they continue to build momentum with a steady stream of new music.\n\nRaised on influences like Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Justin Bieber, and Shawn Mendes, both brothers bring distinct creative backgrounds (acting, fashion, and DJ culture) into a single, authentic vision. Currently working with Los Angeles-based producers including Joel Jones, Brandon Shoop, and Juan Ariza, FAMA represents the meeting point between intimacy and universality, music that feels personal, yet instantly relatable.\n\nFAMA is born from the need to feel without fear. To speak from the heart in a world that so often hides it. They don’t come to be perfect, they come to be real. FAMA doesn’t seek fame; it seeks connection. Every verse, every chord, every silence is an invitation to look inward and recognize yourself, always from a place of love.",

    "description": "‘The Family Battenberg have perfected a filthy, fuzzy psychedelic sound that they’ve coined as “spider rock.” (The Face)\nThe Family Battenberg's 'Anteater' single, released in April 2025, is an independent release by the Cardiff based four-piece. The track was written in just a day, and it was recorded at Tom Rees’ (Buzzard Buzzard Buzzard) studio while he was on holiday. To master the recording the group sought out long-time collaborator Eddie Al-Shakarchi (Boy Azooga, Loathe, Swim Deep.)\n\nAligning with the soundscape that’s signature to them, ‘Anteater’ is The Family Battenberg finessed. Drenched in fuzzy saturation, spacey vocals ricochet between a blistering guitar, all while a double-tracked mono drum plays like a call to action.  This is an anti-love song. When unhealthy adoration becomes a quest for romance, or approval in this case, we find ourselves doing strange things. In this story, the protagonist justifies total metamorphosis in the name of subservience. “It’s self-humiliation in the pursuit of a potential suitor’s attention,” as frontman Eliot puts it. Anyone that has seen this band live before is sure to recognise it from past setlists. The group had played it as an unreleased track amongst their own shows and a host of major festivals, namely,\n\nGreenman, Trans Musicales 2024, Reeperbahn 2024 and ESNS 2025. As budding upcomers, the group have also supported the likes of Getdown Services, Panic Shack, Gruff Rhys and the Bug Club.\n\nChampioned by Steve Lamacq, Amy Lame, Huw Stephens and Adam Walton, the group are already making their mark on the industry.\n\n'Wow I love that, a South Walian answer to Psychedelic Porn Crumpets' John Kennedy, Radio X",

    "description": "Famous Friend is the sun-bleached, indie surf solo project of ASCAP award-winning artist and producer Zachariah Carlson. Born out of the fame-soaked dreamscape of West Los Angeles, Famous Friend began as an alter-ego, a playful mirror of the city’s obsession with image. His music blends washed-out indie surf guitars with sparkling dream pop production and post-punk drums, balancing joy and heartbreak in equal measure.\n\nThe result is nostalgic and cinematic: beach day euphoria melts into late night reflections about relationships past and present. Songs like “Tanlines” and “Nora” have earned millions of streams and support from KCRW tastemakers and helped secure him a spot as a recent member of the prestigious Taco Bell Feed the Beat class of 2025. Amidst all the noise, Famous Friend continues to turn California melancholy into shimmering, golden-hour anthems for dreamers and outsiders.\n\nP.S. The multi-instrumentalist is also a frequent writer, producer, collaborator with some of Los Angeles’s premiere indie and alternative acts like Winnetka Bowling League, Casket Cassette, and Floats as well as composer for shows like the Emmy-Nominated “Alexa & Katie.”",

    "description": "Romar Daniel, known professionally as FATHER ROMAR—formerly Daddy Dinero and affectionately nicknamed “DAD”—is an American rapper, songwriter, and recording engineer based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A distinctive voice in hip-hop, he first emerged as one-third of the influential group FREEWIFI, which signed to LA label Rostrum Records in 2016.\nFREEWIFI debuted with Connected, followed by FREEQUENCY, featuring Romar’s breakout single “1(800)-ASSS.” The track earned placements on BET Jams and REVOLT TV, helping solidify his reputation as a creative force. The group was also featured by outlets including Sway’s Universe, HipHopDX, and Pigeons & Planes. Their single “Rent’s Due” appeared in Season 2, Episode 2 of Showtime’s The Chi, expanding their reach to national TV audiences.\nMusically, ROMAR draws inspiration from Southern rap icons like Lil Wayne, Three 6 Mafia, Mike Jones, J-Kwon, Bone Thugs, and Ludacris. Known for his signature ad-libs—“AHHHHH” and “WHAAATTT”—he blends classic influence with modern innovation. Inspired by artists like A$AP Rocky, he brings bold self-expression through both music and fashion, continuing to evolve from “Daddy” into a boundary-pushing “FATHER.”",

    "description": "Born and raised in La Habana, Cuba, Father carries the rhythm of the island in his blood and the ambition of the streets in his soul. Now based in Austin, Texas, he’s bringing a bold new energy to the global reggaeton‑trap scene — one that fuses Cuban passion, trap swagger, and luxury‑driven ambition into an unmistakable sound.\nFather’s music is defined by dynamic trap bars, rapid‑fire high notes, and a hard‑hitting reggaeton pulse that bridges Latin rhythm and modern trap innovation. Every track radiates his fast‑paced and glamorous lifestyle — a reflection of success earned, not given. With lyrical authenticity and relentless flow, he delivers the intensity of the Cuban streets elevated by the shine of world‑class luxury.\nNow positioned in Austin’s vibrant music scene, Father is ready to redefine how the world experiences Latin trap. His mission is clear: to represent his home, his culture, and the next generation of international Latin sound — all while living life at full speed.\nFather isn’t just an artist. He’s a movement — from La Habana to the world.",

    "description": "When FEET self-released their debut album in 2019, the group offered up a particularly oblique title: What’s Inside Is More Than Just Ham. But once listeners delved into the record, they found sloshing’s of guitar music that careered wildly between indie, psych, and subtle shades of new wave across an exciting and unpredictable 35 minutes. Since then, FEET have seen prominent live shows have seen them supporting the likes of Inhaler and even The Rolling Stones at their huge 2022 Hyde Park shows. The bands second album \"Make It Up\" garnered further critical acclaim with the band being invited to perform a BBC 6Music Live session off the back of the single releases Greasy Boy, Why Would I Lie and The Real Thing.\n\nThe band are returning in 2026 with their third album to be released on Submarine Cat Records amidst a year of heavy touring which will see the band on two UK and European headline stints throughout the album campaign. A very welcome return, then, for one of Britain’s most inventive bands, starting a new chapter afresh that builds on the brilliance of their first outing and takes it to a new level entirely. 2026, it’s fair to say, is ready for Feet to stomp all over it.",

    "description": "Fine Food Market is the folk dream-pop project of Montreal-based multi-disciplinary artist Sophie Perras. Drawing from her training as a classical pianist and inspired by the sound of her beloved PSR3000 keyboard, the songs of Fine Food Market are intuitive, emotional, and fun.\n\nFine Food Market builds from the rudiments of country-folk and the experimental tendencies of the indie genre to articulate a musical place filled with sunny fields, old cars, and brightly painted houses.\n\nBoth eclectic and whimsical, the songs of Fine Food Market can also contain a real sadness, a feeling especially discoverable in her French lyrics. As a bilingual artist she unravels intimate and intricate musings in her own language, writing in a voice reserved for speaking to a close friend. Ultimately sincere, Fine Food Market may also pick up the tools of satire to describe difficult events of her own life.\n\nFine Food Market’s first EP, “I’m afraid to be in love with someone who crashes their car So much” was released in the beginning of March 2025 with Arbutus Records.",

    "description": "Fish Hunt is the musical project of New York native Lucy Mondello. Equipped with a unique affinity for all things careful and sensitive, Lucy’s songwriting is rich and thoughtful, think a homemade meal or a patchwork quilt. She found her voice listening to such artists as Modest Mouse, Johanna Warren, and Animal Collective, which has led her to a unique sonic palette that’s all her own. Her sophomore release, Self Taught, sees her adding to the quilt in a big way, collaborating with many of her musical contemporaries to create a dynamic record that is as courageous as it is cozy. In addition to her own work, Lucy has also played in the live bands of artists Claud, Diet Cig, and waveform*. Recently released LP: Self Taught, January 12th 2024. Upcoming LP: Fall 2026.",

    "description": "Flesh Juicer is Taiwan’s most iconic heavy metal band, formed in 2006 in Taichung. Blending Deathcore and Hardcore with electronic textures and traditional pentatonic scales, they’ve forged a distinctive Taiwanese metal sound rooted in local culture. Their music draws inspiration from folk religion, temple processions, and social realities, transforming raw energy into a visceral expression of contemporary Taiwan.\nFlesh Juicer’s work has consistently earned critical acclaim both in Taiwan and internationally. Their debut album ‘GIGO’ (2015) won the Golden Indie Music Award for Best Rock Album, while ‘Deep Sea Fairy Tale’ (2018) earned nominations at the AIM Independent Music Awards（US）. In 2021, ‘GOLDEN Taizi BRO’ swept three GIMA trophies, Best Live Performance, Best Band, and Best Album, solidifying their status as Taiwan’s metal powerhouse.\n\nKnown for massive sold-out shows of over 5,000 fans, Flesh Juicer has brought their electrifying performances to Clockenflap (Hong Kong), Summer Sonic (Japan), and Hammer Sonic (Indonesia). With a new album set for release in 2026 and a North American tour in the works, Flesh Juicer is not only a flagship band in Taiwan’s metal scene but also demonstrates strong potential to make a lasting impact on the global stage.",

    "description": "The Inland Empire can either suffocate you or make you work even harder. For the past 10 years, Manuel Joseph Walker’s prolific output as Foliage has helped him become a widely recognized figurehead in modern Shoegaze. A chameleonic producer, Walker draws from the broader palettes of Post-Punk while slyly incorporating textures and ideas from Hip-Hop and Electronic records, revealing ephemeral but lasting impressions that feel simultaneously intimate and ritualistic, something you can listen to in your headphones late at night or shout along with a cold lager in your hand. His song “It’s Time” has been featured in nearly 19K TikToks from brands such as Le Creuset, F1, & Netflix.\n\nWith his latest single “Missing Hearts”, featuring a music video he directed, Walker has produced his most arena-ready tune yet. With millions of streams and a reputation for unforgettable live performances, Foliage has evolved from best-kept secret to cornerstone of Indie's next generation of hitmakers. In the wake of their first full-length record in six years on the way, Foliage is poised to make a massive splash at this year’s SXSW and all through 2026.",

    "description": "Future Nobodies is a genre-bending trio from Chicago, IL. Influenced by the 2000’s NYC indie scene as well as 1980’s post-punk and new wave, the band has developed a nostalgic, emotionally charged sound that is solely their own. Often described as “sad happy music to dance to,” the trio croon like Morrissey over bass heavy melodies and crying guitar licks.\nThe band released their first album in 2021 (Hotel Del La Muerte) as an online project that gained immediate traction. In 2022 they released their Over it/Apasionada EP. “Over It” was placed on an official Spotify playlist causing the song to reach over a million streams and gain the band over 50K monthly listeners overnight. In 2023 they performed at Riot Fest. The line up included acts such as Death Cab For Cutie, Queens of the Stoneage, and The Cure. In 2024 they released their self-titled sophomore album, Future Nobodies. The album was picked up and distributed by Young & Cold Records. With the record labels help, the band made their European debut at Germany’s annual Wave Gotik Treffen Festival. Since then, the band has gained underground popularity and is currently touring cities across the U.S.",

    "description": "Georgia Webster grew up in a small town in western Massachusetts, where quiet days and wide-open space gave her the freedom to write songs from a young age. With a guitar in hand and artists like Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne in her headphones, she found her voice early, and it didn’t take long for others to notice. After building a devoted audience online, Georgia made the move to Nashville, where she found herself opening for artists Kelsea Ballerini & Ingrid Andress.\n\nNow stepping into her next chapter, Georgia is embracing a pop-driven sound that blends the warmth and storytelling of early 2000s pop rock—pulling inspiration from artists like Sheryl Crow, Jewel, and Tori Kelly—with the intimacy and emotional honesty of modern voices like Gracie Abrams and Maggie Rogers. But it’s not just about the music…it’s about the message. Georgia is becoming a voice for the next generation of female songwriters, creating a space where people can be themselves, share the stories that make them human, and connect beyond the screen. Whether she’s writing, performing, or building community in real life, her mission is clear: have fun, care deeply, and help others feel seen through creativity.",

    "description": "Girl Tones, of planet Earth, are a high-energy rock duo brought to life by two sisters named Kenzie and Laila. Both classically trained musicians, Kenzie transitioned from cello to guitar and Laila from piano to drums in an effort to electrify sentient beings from this galaxy to the next. Their debut releases were produced by Brad Shultz of Cage The Elephant and released via his label Parallel Vision in partnership with Big Loud Rock.\nTheir first offerings have earned the praise of Rolling Stone, VICE, Consequence, PAPER, NME, DORK and many others with Flaunt saying, “Their sound is fluid, and yet with each release, they evolve as a harmonious group, developing their unique sound as one.”\nGirl Tones has toured with Cage The Elephant across the globe, as well as The Velveteers, hey, nothing. and Silversun Pickups in North America. Making their unignorable festival debut at Lollapalooza, Shaky Knees, Austin City Limits and more, Rolling Stone said, “While the White Stripes — their most obvious comparison — were about controlled energy, Girl Tones are proudly imperfect.”\nAs the band jumps into 2026, they have no shortage of new music and new tour dates up their sleeves.",

    "description": "Austin alt-pop trio Glass Mansions create music that moves — propulsive beats, heavy synths, and intimate pop melodies led by the sultry, unmistakable voice of Jayna Doyle.\n\nLive, it’s pure Rock n’ Roll – raw, sweaty, passionate and covered in a cloud of fog and confetti – and chances are you’ve probably seen them at some point or another as they’ve crisscrossed the country, playing places like SXSW for the past 3 years and Warped Tour, Canadian Music Week, Illfest, Indie Week Canada, and Florida Music Festival before that. They've also shared the stage with bands like Phantogram, Robert Delong, Young The Giant, Urban Heat and The Unlikely Candidates along the way.\n\nTheir music has been featured on MTV, Netflix and Bravo and after releasing the fiery \"STANDING O\" in 2022 and sultry \"NEARSIGHTED\" in 2023 to both streaming success and critical acclaim the band has returned with the dark alt-pop track \"VIOLET\" and accompanying music video to finish the trilogy.\n\nIn 2025 the band was selected to become a Sonic Guild Artist, accelerating their creative output. Look for a brand new single to be released just before SXSW.",

    "description": "Glassio is the Dream-Pop–tinged Indie-Dance project of Irish-Iranian songwriter and producer Sam R. Blending melodic sweetness with brooding dance beats, his self-described “melancholy disco” sound has earned over 25 million streams and global acclaim. Since emerging with the viral 2016 EP Poptimism (whose single “Try Much Harder” hit No. 9 on Spotify’s Global Viral Chart), Glassio has toured internationally with acts like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Nada Surf, and Electric Youth, and released two acclaimed LPs—For the Very Last Time (2020, Downtown Music) and See You Shine (2022)—with songs featured on Netflix and HBO. Raised between the Middle East and California and later based in New York and London, Sam draws influence from New Wave, 60s chamber pop, and early-2000s electronica, channeling it into rich, cinematic pop. His upcoming third album, The Imposter (2026), written during his move from New York to London, fuses shoegaze, folk, and dream pop in a neo-noir exploration of self-confrontation and creative rebirth. “I wanted this album to make people ask if they’re living the life they’re meant to,” he says. “For me, this is about rediscovering who I am as an artist.",

    "description": "Since 1999, international punk band Gogol Bordello, led by Ukrainian frontman Eugene Hütz, has been filling up rooms with an energy that could run a whole city. A lifelong lover of the punk scene growing up in Ukraine, Hütz finally found himself where he felt he belonged, in New York’s Lower East Side in the late 90s, where he went to shows and later performed at the legendary CBGB. Crashing at friends’ apartments and playing acoustic sets in NYC Ukrainian bars, his group steadily grew to an 8 piece multicultural band, combining Eastern, Western and Latin traditions. Since then the band has lit up stages around the world alongside System of a Down, Primus, Rancid, Dropkick Murphys, dueted with Regina Spektor, and cut albums with legends Rick Rubin, Steve Albini and a forthcoming album with Nic Launay.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine is personal for Eugene & the band, who have been tirelessly advocating for Ukrainian solidarity, partnering with Nova Ukraine, ArtDopomoga, and putting together benefits with Patti Smith, The Hold Steady, Suzanne Vega, Magnetic Fields, Matisyahu and more. Additionally, they collaborated with Bernard Sumner on a cover of the Angelic Upstarts “Solidarity” with proceeds going to the Ukrainian Soldiers Recovery.\n\nGogol Bordello’s forthcoming record, We Mean It, Man!, is due out in March 2026. For this album, Hütz set out to blend post-punk textures and aggro to Gogol Bordello’s free-wheeling gypsy-punk. He chose to work with the production team of Nick Launay (Gang of Four, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Idles) and Adam “Atom” Greenspan (Nick Cave, Idles, Flogging Molly) to accomplish this goal. Together with his long running band, they knocked out twelve super punchy and hook-laden songs. The title track, “We Mean It, Man!” is all pile-driving punk intensity which crescendoes into no-wave sax skronk. “No Time For Idiots” is a Strummer/Jones-esque riff-punk with a giant chorus payoff. “Life Is Possible Again” voices an optimism against the dread of the Ukraine war. “Solidarity” features New Order’s Bernard Sumner on the Angelic Upstart’s Solidarność-punk anthem updated to address the Ukraine war effort. This is the album and political message the world needs now.",

    "description": "Good Flying Birds is a jangling, noisy guitar-pop group based in the Midwest, USA. It began in 2023 with a collection of 4-track cassette recordings and stop-motion videos uploaded to YouTube under the name “Talulah God,” along with a chaotic and colorful, GIF-infested website. Over the following months, songs were uploaded fairly frequently, eventually catching the attention of influential label operator Martin Meyer. In early 2025, Talulah’s Tape was released on Rotten Apple, a collection of home recordings from 2020–2024. It showcased a wide-ranging love for the history of independent guitar music, clever and melodic songwriting, and an approachable twee-punk charm. Following the success of the tape and gaining a reputation as a must-see live act, they signed with Carpark and Smoking Room, who co-released Talulah’s Tape in late 2025. The influence of jangly lo-fi/DIY heavyweights who came before like Guided By Voices (their namesake), Beat Happening, DLIMC, Talulah Gosh (partly their namesake), and The Vaselines, is prevalent, but they carry a unique charm all their own. It’s the sound of looking at a crumbling world with rosy cheeks and wide eyes, a tambourine by your side.",

With an attack that is both relentless and melodic, the all-female band are a genuinely unique proposition - refusing to be pigeon holed, they are here to shake up perceptions with their intelligent, stylish and raucous take on rock music.\n\nCiting influences from Nirvana to Porridge Radio and Idles to boygenius, the band have been developing their dynamic songwriting. The music moves between aggressive and heavy instrumentation and slower, more melodic passages, creating a powerful contrast. They use their voices to create layered harmonies and the result is a unique and expansive sound.\n\nThe band have supported Idles, Big Special, Katy J Pearson and Arxx. They’ve been championed by BBC Introducing and BBC Radio 1 and have had BBC 6 Music support from Steve Lamacq, Emily Pilbeam and Amy Lamé.",

    "description": "The Gringos are an indie rock band building a real-world scene.\nBorn from house shows, late-night living room sessions, and college basements, their sound blends raw indie rock energy with melodic songwriting and a loose, lived-in Southern warmth. Their music feels like something you stumbled into — loud enough to feel alive, honest enough to feel personal.\n\nThe Gringos aren’t just a band — they’re building a community. From packed college rooms to growing regional tours, their shows feel less like concerts and more like gatherings. The kind where strangers become friends, choruses get screamed back, and everyone leaves feeling like they found something.\n\nIf you’re looking for polished pop — look somewhere else.\nIf you’re looking for your new favorite band before everyone else finds them — welcome.",

    "description": "Grocery Bag are the latest in a new breed of face-melting rock & roll straight out of Austin, Texas. The garage rock-psych-punk 4 piece, led by diminutive singer Bella Martinez, have been tearing up stages around Texas since 2023, being handpicked by the likes of Osees, Frankie & The Witch Fingers & Farmer's Wife to support on multiple shows as well as a critically-acclaimed set at Levitation Festival 2024. Following this breakthrough performance, the band were added as main support on Psychedelic Porn Crumpets tour in April/May 2025, playing 22 shows & solidifying their reputation as one of the best live bands in the country. Their debut album 'Break You' (released in Nov 2023) is a great raw snapshot of young talented musicians creating something exciting, to-the-point, that leaves you replaying time & time again. New music is expected early 2026!",

    "description": "Grupo Ferrary Show was created in Guerrero Mexico by a group of friends that had a deep love for music. Eventually all the group members ended up in the United States and have been gigging for the passed 30 years. Over the 30 years, there have been many changes in band members and adjustments to management. Now there is a new generation of musicians that have solidified the genre for Grupo Ferrary Show in Cumbia Sonidera. On our regular gigs, Grupo Ferrary Show is known to play a variety of genres, but have a really strong foundation for Cumbias. Now we have a couple cover songs out and some music videos to get the name out there with more music in the pipeline. Grupo Ferrary Show tries to keep pushing the boundaries of Cumbia Sonidera so that it can reach a much larger crowd.",

    "description": "Gus Baldwin is a singer/songwriter/ex-hippie/part-time punk from Austin, TX. After a stint holding down drums for Dallas surf punks Sealion in high school, Baldwin went on to form the Psych Pop combo Acid Carousel, which he led for 6 years and 20 something releases before departing the band. Moving to Austin, Baldwin started quickly self releasing a string of singles and EPs on his own GetWithIt! Imprint and establishing himself as the godson of Texas Rock n Roll. Teaming up with former bandmates and friends Gus formed The Sketch in 2022. Embracing the aggression of dirty punk, the looseness of garage, and the charm of power pop, The Sketch established themselves as new cornerstones of the Austin rock scene. Recording their debut LP with the group in one day of recording in LA in the spring of 2024, “The Sketch” is the culmination of Baldwin’s vision, manifested through the power of The Sketch themselves. In late 2025, Baldwin released his first full length solo LP. With the selt-titled debut, Gus focuses in on his rock n' roll stylings, while at the same time showing great versatility as a songwriter. Not being afraid to mix opposite loves of Punk and Pop into one cohesive album.",

Back in January 2020, right at the dawn of the pandemic, Englehorn released his first album, Death & Transfiguration [...] But even as life has since opened up again, Englehorn is still firmly situated in a world of his own madcap design. Where 2022’s Dungeon Master walked the tightrope between DIY discord and prog-scaled storytelling, his third album, The Hornbook, magically transmutes the entire history of 20th-century rock ‘n’ roll—’50s golden oldies, ‘60s garage spunk, ‘70s glam flamboyance,‘80s indie transgression, ‘90s lo-fi weirdness—into an alien transmission from the future. The Hornbook was mixed by Paul Leary from the legendary punk band Butthole Surfers and marked the beginning of a fruitful collaboration. Leary and Englehorn reunited on The Broken Balladeer, due February 27th 2026, this time with Leary taking on the role of producer. They also enlisted the help of industry legends Stuart Sullivan, Howie Weinberg and Kramer.",

The duo blends elements of hardcore rap, free-jazz, distorted electronic music and punk energy into 3 minute explosions of catchy catharsis. The chaos they curate is driven home through their live shows where Dilick and Oviedo's back and forth vocals, noise breakdowns, sample flips, and sense of playfulness create a must see live performance that is energetically engaging and delightfully disorienting. haha Laughing has released multiple EP's and singles since 2021, and released their first album \"LOSING TEETH DREAM\" in May of 2025. Their follow up EP \"BIG WHATEVER\" is set to be released Spring 2026. haha Live. haha Laugh. haha Love.",

    "description": "Hana Lili is on a mission to pursue her truth. For the Welsh artist, songwriting has always been a way to make sense of what words can’t quite hold. Her self-titled EP, Hana, marks her boldest step yet — an intimate collection that distils emotion into its rawest form. Blending confessional storytelling with the dynamic spirit of 90s and early 00s alt-rock, Hana crafts\nsongs that balance vulnerability and power. Drawing inspiration from artists like Alanis Morissette, Radiohead and Gwen Stefani, she channels emotional honesty through soaring melodies and unfiltered energy. Each song feels like a conversation with herself — an exploration of identity, doubt, and the small moments that shape who we are.\nHana’s music merges introspection with rebellion, turning personal chaos into connection. Raised in Wales and a first-language Welsh speaker, Hana’s sense of place runs deep. Her roots in the Welsh Eisteddfod tradition — a celebration of language, music, and storytelling — instilled in her a lasting belief in the power of creative expression.\nWith a sound that bridges intimacy and universality, Hana Lili stands as one of alt-pop’s most distinct and fearless emerging voices.",

    "description": "Searching. Playfulness. Rediscovery of the once known. These thoughts permeate through Hanorah’s creative impulse. The multidisciplinary Canadian artist, chiefly known for her\npowerful emotive voice, transforms the old into the new as she charts waters at once familiar and unknown. Weaving influences from RnB, rock, and shoegaze, she’s ready to redefine what soul music can be, exploring new sonic landscapes as she creates something both fresh and timeless.\n\nHer new EP, Closer Than Hell, is a collection born from that very tension—between desire and uncertainty, between the things you don’t know and the parts of yourself you’re afraid to face. The theme of searching threads through each song, a quiet but persistent pull toward something elusive, something just out of reach. You hear it in the aching vulnerability of her lyrics, the way her voice rises and falls as if chasing after a feeling that might only exist for a fleeting second, before slipping away. But there’s play in it too. Her EP is about the delicate, messy dance between letting go and holding on—about being lost but also willing to find the joy in the search.",

From origins of psychedelic folk pop and 70s cosmic Americana, Haylie’s sound is an infectious alternative take on modern pop music, with plenty of hooks and a huge chorus; she is the Carly Simon for post-Generation Z. Her euphoric range sits somewhere between Joan Baez, Carole King and Emmylou Harris.\n\n“Gently hued Laurel Canyon folk-pop songs” - Rolling stone",

    "description": "Hector Gannet are from the town of North Shields, high on England’s north east coast. Things centre on lead singer-songwriter Aaron Duff whose compositions draw closely on his beloved home terrain. Yet Hector Gannet’s music – folk, rock, ancient, modern – also reaches out into the wider world. Hector Gannet have been praised by music lovers from Chris Packham to Sam Fender, while Uncut magazine acclaimed the band as “North Shields’ answer to Crazy Horse”. There have been live dates with artists from Elbow, Sea Power to Lindisfarne, Richard Thompson & Kathryn Williams – & massive shows with Sam Fender at the vast North Eastern shrine that is St James’ Park football ground. Hector Gannet have drawn pleasing reactions. On BBC 6 Music, musician and broadcaster Tom Robinson greeted a “band of exceptional talent”. In a **** review, MOJO magazine saluted the “pointedly political, natural-world-advocating folk rock” of their The Land Belongs To Us album. Louder Than War website put Hector Gannet among 25 bands to change your life. Forthcoming album includes rousing soul sermons which blend their North Eastern heart with touches of Dexy’s, Style Council-period Weller and a bit of the Boss",

    "description": "Henry Flower is the cult rock alter-ego created by David Van Witt, who derives great inspiration from his peculiar upbringing. Born in Belgium and raised in a meditation community in Iowa, Van Witt spent his childhood moving around the US with his single, clairvoyant mother who remembers her own birth. Flower and his musical collective and live band dubbed The Infinite Void interpret these childhood memories through a spiritual, dreamlike lens for their debut album, VISIONS OF THE DAYTIME MOON (October, 2023).\n\nDuring the album’s six-year writing process, Flower incorporated meditation, drone music, hypnosis, improvisation, and other eclectic techniques to produce an indie rock record that is as imaginative as it is classic. In the album, Flower ponders the mysteries of life in poetic croons over a bed of psychedelic flutes, soulful piano, 70s guitars, bouncing congas, gospel choirs, new age beats, and innovative production.\n\nWith his seven-piece live band, The Infinite Void, Henry Flower proselytizes his imagined religion, praising the infinite void and building a cult-like following with electric, church-like live performances.\n\nHenry Flower and his band are an iconic NYC entity, gathering over 30 players on their roster throughout their six-year album process. Musicians on their upcoming album and seven preceding singles include co-producer Sam Cohen (Kevin Morby, Dangermouse, Sharon Van Etten), Melanie Chambers (Oracle Sisters, Widowspeak, Lovetempo), Mattie Safer (The Rapture, Poolside), Abdon Valdez III (Cornelia Murr), Rosie Slater (Darlene Love, Delicate Steve), and saxophonist/flutist Walter Fancourt (Yeasayer, Super Yamba Band).",

    "description": "Holly Macve is an Irish-born, English-raised singer, songwriter, and producer known for her cinematic, haunting sound that blends Americana, alt-country, and dream pop. Described by Record Collector as “an ethereal offspring of Nick Cave blessed with the stark musical backdrop of Johnny Cash’s ‘American’ series of recordings,” she has spent the last decade penning immersive anthems of love, loss, and spiritual searching - revealing a born storyteller with a deep longing for human experience and a romantic curiosity about the world around her.\n\nIt’s no wonder her talents caught the attention of Lana Del Rey who, after featuring on Holly’s single ‘Suburban House’, declared her “one of the most beautiful singing voices in the world.”\n\nWith a voice described as “celestial” by The Line of Best Fit, Macve moves between fragility and force, writing timeless melodies that explore heartbreak, escape, and existential longing.\n\nFollowing three critically acclaimed albums, Holly has relocated to the US and is currently recording her fourth studio album.",

Trading guitars for restless grooves and twitchy synths, the band dissect the chaos of modern life with wit and precision. Dual vocalists Will Harrison and Lois Kelly explore jealousy, self-doubt and overthinking across ten hook-laden tracks that balance melancholy and euphoria. Already acclaimed for their electrifying live shows, Humdrum cements Home Counties as one of the UK’s most inventive new bands.",

    "description": "Amsterdam-based shoegaze outfit Honey I’m Home has feared they are cursed ever since their rehearsal space burned down the day before their first show, but recent happenings might have you believe the curse has lifted. Early 2026 they’re named as the #1 emerging act at Europe’s leading showcase festival (ESNS): “Honey I’m Home is the coolest new band from the Netherlands. The packed room gets their faces melted off, but at times also gets a breather in the shape of a beautiful verse. The unexpected breaks, original melodies and smart tempo changes give the set its own, authentic sound.”\n\nPowerfully capturing the raw energy of '90s alternative rock by acts like the Smashing Pumpkins & My Bloody Valentine and blending it with a fresh, modern sound, they've created their own unique take on the shoegaze, indie, and emo genres. On stage, the band’s full power is unleashed: captivating live shows that balance between fragile intimacy and explosive outbursts.\n\nThe band toured with Rocket, Hotline TNT & Foxing in the EU & UK, and played key EU showcase festivals including ESNS, Reeperbahn & Left of the Dial. New single Pretty got featured on Line of Best Fit, BBC6 & Melomania on Spotify.",

    "description": "Hot Garbage melt into a heavily volatile yet undeniably palatable amalgamation of sonic elements. Calling on the driving rhythms of dark post-punk and motorik krautrock, the Toronto-based outfit seamlessly works shining melodies and swirling textures into deliberate, brooding arrangements. Since forming in 2015, the four-piece have toured extensively throughout Canada, the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom, bringing their intense live sets to festivals such as Levitation, Freakout Fest, Treefort, SXSW, Sled Island, FME, M for Montreal and Pop Montreal, and sharing the stage with notable acts such as Osees, Ty Segall, L.A. Witch, Frankie and the Witch Fingers, JJUUJJUU, Mdou Moctar, Wand and Kikagaku Moyo. The quartet recently returned with Precious Dream (January 19, 2024 via Mothland & Exag’ Records), a sprawling collection of songs written in isolation and brought together alongside visionary producer Graham Walsh (METZ, Preoccupations, Holy Fuck, !!!), offering an exhilarating new breath into the world of post-punk and modern psychedelia, a listening experience that is equally cathartic and introspective.",

    "description": "We are a Mexican lead British 3-piece alternative post-grunge rock band. Starting in early 2022, our lead singer moved from Mexico to the UK. The band formed after an impromptu rehearsal session and discovering the chemistry we had playing together we quickly got to work. Writing, playing gigs and recording, releasing our first single in that same year, shortly followed by our debut EP Lonesome Joy. We are now about to release our debut Album with the first few singles already out and their music videos on YouTube hitting almost half a million views.\nHailing from Mexico, Giselle brought to the UK her unique taste and a talent for writing folk pop, looking to explore a new musical direction fuelled by a passion for rock. Finding Cameron and Charlie, two British born and raised musicians marked the inception of I See Orange, mixing multiple genres into their unique post-grunge sound, a deliberate combo of captivating melodies, clever lyricism and heavy rock.\nBringing raw energy, heavy riffs and powerful melodic vocals to every stage we hit. We blend the gritty, nostalgic sound of the 90's with our own unique twist.",

    "description": "I-SKY, West Malaysian based Producer-DJ - inspired by the likes\nof Skrillex, Baauer, TNGHT and Boys Noize; started with shows that always promised a\ntailored selection expanding from his favourite local/regional products to carefully curated underground dance finds from his internet digs, he since has established himself as a household name in the 2010s KL nightlife scene.\n\nWhile DJ-ing has always been a conduit for his artistry, I-SKY delivers his crafted studio-to-stage experience best as both an artist and passionate producer. Known for his fresh-to-death remixes, I-SKY originals ride along the same wavelength too through his constant redefinitions of electronic dance.\nThough the name doesn't have any literal meaning, the autodidactic disciplinary defines his namesake with, \"I just needed\nto find a catchy name... to find something that rhymes with my first initial, hence, the I... and SKY. Over the years, I guess the name gave meaning to itself. There's a saying: the sky is the limit. I've always hated being stuck in a box. I like to let my creativity run wild. To be free to experiment & dabble in different sounds & styles. So, l am the limit to what I can and wanna do.\"",

With family ties to Quiroga, Michoacán, Jiménez, Chihuahua, and Huehuetlán el Chico, Puebla, their songs carry the weight of two cultures, three journeys, and one voice that speaks from the heart.\n\nThey grew up listening to everything — from the romantic ballads their parents played at family gatherings to the raw, emotional sounds of corridos tumbados and alternative rock. That blend of influence shows up in their music, where traditional meets modern, and every lyric is grounded in real feeling. For Fernando, Jesús, and Carlos Ilusión is more than a name — it’s a reflection of their dreams, struggles, and everything they’ve felt along the way. Their sound isn’t boxed into one genre because they don’t live in just one world.",

    "description": "The Irrepressibles is the project of Jamie Irrepressible, composer, vocalist, producer, and visual conceptualist known for emotional performance and genre-blurring sound. A defining voice in queer art pop and alternative performance, Jamie blends classical beauty, alt-pop experimentation, and bold visual concepts.\n\nDebuting with Mirror Mirror (2010) and its global hit In This Shirt—now over 325M streams and widely used in film and TV—The Irrepressibles gained a devoted international following. Follow-ups Nude (2012) and Superheroes (2020) expanded this cinematic, intimate world.\n\nWith Yo Homo! (2024), hailed as “a milestone in queer indie rock” and “desire paired with alt-rock swagger,” Jamie entered a raw, sexually candid, and sonically adventurous new phase.\n\nThe Irrepressibles have performed sold-out shows at Barbican Centre, Royal Festival Hall, and Latitude Festival, and collaborated with Röyksopp, ionnalee, and Tinlicker.\n\nThrough music, video, and performance, Jamie explores identity, sensuality, freedom, and connection, standing as one of the most compelling queer voices in contemporary music.",

    "description": "Isak Thomas and The Stoop Boys is a soul/funk collective of artists primarily based out of Austin, Texas, and Nashville. Originally founded in Boston, MA, by Isak “Thomas” Kotecki (keyboard/guitar/vocals) in 2017, Isak began collaborating with close friends from music school, Connor Frawley (bass/vocals) and John Cattini (lead guitar/vocals), with a shared love of ’70s soul, funk, and rock music.\nWhen the three eventually moved their separate ways across the country, they continued to convene once a year for a week of writing and recording. This tradition has stayed true through three EPs and two albums, garnering millions of streams and features such as KUTX’s Song of the Day.\nThe group has a unique take on its writing process, with every member serving as a rotating writer and vocalist, centered around native Austinite Isak Kotecki as producer. In the latest full album release, 'The Stoop Boys', the group saw the addition of Armando Baeza (drums/vocals) and Logan “Wildman” Garza (vocals/percussion), also joining as writers.\nThe Stoop Boys aim to bring music that feels like yesterday, hits like today, and sticks with you tomorrow.",

    "description": "Describing J’cuuzi as a band is at the very least inaccurate, or worse: incorrect. While they deliver electrifying, borderline acrobatic live performances of high octane, glitchy songs that modulate between serrated post punk guitar and pulsing electro beats, there is a shocking theatricality to them that the word “band” lacks the range to capture. The members wear handmade couture, with bulbous anime-esque proportions and insectile features sewn into drag silhouettes. They often perform while stacked on top of each other, or hoisted over each other’s heads. Their stage is set like a cheap studio apartment: a spinning blue egg chair and a stack of guitar amps sit on either side of a bedazzled ironing board, from which a spinning disco ball hangs. Since their inception in February 2024, J’cuuzi’s ferocity has earned them opening slots for acts like Viagra Boys, Stereolab, Tune-Yards, Shannon and the Clams, Upchuck, Snooper, and Warmduscher. Whether you call them a band, a performance art troupe, or a fashion house; J’cuuzi has set a pace of expansion and experimentation that proves theirs is an act worth watching.",

Her debut EP BUD & DENI (2025) channels grief, legacy and life in Western Sydney into razor-sharp, deeply personal anthems.\n\nAfter years of cultivating a cult following across clubs, fashion runways and spaces like Dark Mofo, Phoenix Central Park and Sydney Festival, Jamaica now brings her explosive show to SXSW Austin as the inaugural Walk to Austin Award recipient.",

    "description": "At just 24, Jamie Duffy has emerged as one of Ireland’s most compelling new artists, blending folk, classical, and contemporary influences into a sound that’s both intimate and cinematic. His debut single Solas became the most streamed debut by an Irish artist since Hozier’s Take Me To Church, with over 135+ million streams on Spotify, 27 million YouTube views, and 7.3 billion views on TikTok.\n\nIn 2024, he released his debut EP On A Wing, sold out his first Irish headline tour (2,600+ tickets), and supported Andrea Bocelli and Hans Zimmer at BST Hyde Park.\n\nIn October 2025, he released his highly anticipated debut album Jamie Duffy. Crafted over two years between wild coastlines and still nights across the two awe-inspiring landscapes of Ireland and Iceland, the album reflects Jamie’s rural Monaghan roots, shaped by changing environments, Irish folklore, love, light and trepidation. It is a true labour of love and effort rarely known by those in their early twenties, but for Jamie, it was a journey he’s been working towards for some time. While evident themes of nature, journey, light and hope spring forward from early listens, the messages within the album, will hopefully, be different for everyone.\n\nAlongside the album, Jamie has scored his first feature film 500 Miles, (starring Bill Nighy and Maisie Williams) due to be released in 2026. Reuniting with his album producer Atli Örvarsson at his home studio in London, the project highlights the creative strength and synergy between the two collaborators.\n\nWith over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify and sold out dates across Ireland, UK and Europe, Jamie is cementing his status as a formidable and rapidly rising global artist whose music continues to resonate with a massive and expanding international audience.",

She also holds the distinction of being the first ambassador for the fashion house Miu Miu across the Middle East.\n\nAt 23, Diab continues carving a space that honors her heritage while defying easy categorisation — a voice for third‑culture youth finding clarity through art.",

Her sonic palette makes sense when she describes the music she was most interested in growing up. “The earliest memories I have are of driving down to see my grandparents, and we listened to different music in the car on my dad’s iPod,” she recalls, “There’d be David Gray, Tracy Chapman, Dido, Gipsy Kings, The Eagles – old songs, classic albums. And I feel like they went into my psyche. I’m obsessed with any kind of acoustic, well-played guitar.”\n\nShe also references her love of R&B and a current new love with Fontaines DC (“the first time I heard them they grabbed my heart; if my music does what they and other artists do for me and moves them to feel something, I’d be happy”). There is also mention of the emotional resonance of watching Bollywood films with her Gujarati grandmother back when she was a kid: “In terms of vocals, I do think that’s made a bit of an impact,” she says of those Hindi songs she internalised.",

    "description": "Jamaican-Irish rapper JayaHadADream is one of the UK’s most exciting new voices, blending raw, introspective lyricism with grime and hip hop influences. Raised in Cambridge and shaped artistically in Nottingham, she took an unconventional path into music—starting a career teaching A-Level Criminology at just 21, before leaving the profession in 2023 to pursue music full-time. Her breakout came in 2024 when she won the Glastonbury Emerging Talent Competition, handpicked by Michael and Emily Eavis, earning a coveted slot on one of the festival’s main stages. Since then, she’s lit up Reading, Leeds, Boomtown, BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend, and SXSW London, with a range of packed sets at Glastonbury 2025. Known for her emotive delivery and sharp pen, Jaya has received critical acclaim from Rolling Stone UK, NME, and TRENCH, with airplay on BBC Radio 1, Capital Xtra and Kiss. Her bold, genre-spanning sound has led to standout collaborations in both rap and electronic music, including tracks with Zero and Gardna. With co-signs from Mick Jenkins, Stormzy and so many more, JayaHadADream is defining the future of UK rap.",

Her effortless, unmistakable voice delivers songs that are both deeply personal and irresistibly catchy. After featuring on Nurko & Last Heroes’ “Promise Me,” Chambers broke through with singles like “Guess U Suck” (850K+ streams) and “Fever Dream,” which landed on Spotify’s Fresh Finds Pop.\nIn 2025, she was featured on Algorhythm by Los Wizzards, a project nominated for a 2026 Grammy Award, marking a career milestone and highlighting her versatility as an artist and collaborator. Her music will also be featured in the upcoming short film Lake St. Claire, written & directed by Caitlin Meyernik, expanding her work into film and visual storytelling.\nHer single “Fall Right Back” made waves across streaming and social media and was highlighted by Women in Music as one of their Top Songs of 2025. Chambers’ performances have taken her from The Troubadour to Revolution Live, opening for Saint Motel, appearing in respected showcases nationwide, and making her SXSW debut this year. With new music on the way, Jessie Chambers continues to carve a singular path through today’s indie-pop landscape.",

His foundation in the performing arts began with theater in middle school, followed by extensive ballet training throughout high school and college. He trained at the Richmond Ballet, Appomattox Regional Governor’s School for the Arts and Technology, and the SUNY Purchase Conservatory of Dance. During these years of formal dance training, he also taught himself to play guitar and sing.\n\nJonathan began performing music full-time at nineteen, with his first gig quickly evolving into a residency. He started writing original material at twenty-six. At twenty-eight, he released his first single, \"Divine,\" followed by his second single, \"Gesture,\" which featured a music video showcasing his first dance project.\n\nHis songwriting is rooted in deep self-reflection. Jonathan describes his creative process as stemming from \"a point at which my awareness truly stretches over new ground. I feel out the unknown with sound.\"",

    "description": "JOPLYN is a Berlin-based electronic live act moving between melodic house, techno, and electronica, guided by a distinct voice - both literal and emotional. Writing, producing, and performing exclusively original material, her live shows unfold as immersive experiences where vocals, synths, and improvisation meet intuition and intensity.\nHer music has traveled widely through collaborations with artists such as Booka Shade, Röyksopp, Robyn, Damian Lazarus, MK, and Jan Blomqvist, with releases on labels including Defected, Get Physical, Diynamic, Crosstown Rebels, Mobilee, and Watergate Records. In 2022, Pete Tong named her BBC Radio 1’s Future Star.\nBeyond the club, JOPLYN’s work reflects a growing curiosity for depth, vulnerability, and transformation. After more than 150 shows worldwide, including Ibiza residencies at Hï Ibiza and WooMoon/Cova Santa and a debut at Coachella’s Yuma Tent, she is opening a new chapter. She is currently working on her fourth studio album, set for release in 2026 on her own label None Of The Above (N.O.T.A.) Berlin, exploring a more expansive and emotionally resonant sound.",

    "description": "\"Pain is a fine knife sharpened by love.\" So says Joudy frontman Diego Ramirez when reflecting on the NYC group's latest endeavors. This emotional clarity and exposed honesty is a hallmark of the band's most vital, intense era yet. Set aside are the evocative lyrics and lush soundscapes of their earlier releases. In their place, lyrical and sonic directness is embraced on the unvarnished and love-torn upcoming album Permanent Maintenance (out DATE on Trash Casual). This is a record that distills Joudy's soaring rock into something simply shorter, louder, and stronger.\n\nFor the trio, rounded out by fellow Venezuelan emigres Hulrich Navas (drums) and Carlos Rey (bass), this streamlining is just another natural step forward as they uncompromisingly blaze a trail amongst life's shadowy moments.\n\nJoudy have always tried to make sense of \"this messy universe\". While the wide angle lens fantasies of recent albums, Obertura and Destroy All Monsters, sought to do that through grand expositions, Permanent Maintenance brings it down to the most acute of human experiences: to love and to lose. While these are deeply personal songs, they are universal.",

    "description": "Joyeria (pronounced Joy-ah-ree-ah) is a London-based outfit led by a Canadian-Polish songwriter who famously spent years quitting bands at their peak to keep his creative soul intact. Now a staple of London's underground scene, the group is a vehicle for \"working in the dark\"—a shape-shifting project that prizes sincerity over polish.\n\nMusically, Joyeria delivers a darkly comic blend of slacker indie and experimental post-punk. Fronted by a deadpan baritone, the songs tackle the absurdity of modern adulthood, capitalism, and workday fatigue with biting, sardonic wit. Their EPs, FIM and Graceful Degradation, were produced by Dan Carey, captured raw and live-to-tape to preserve the \"chaos\" of the moment rather than a rehearsed demo.\n\nWhile born from a singular vision, Joyeria is a formidable four-piece band. Known for being \"purposely under-rehearsed,\" the ensemble thrives on improvisation, ensuring no two sets are the same. With a stage presence that balances Ian Curtis’s intensity with Stephen Malkmus’s irony, the band utilizes an unpredictable, dissonant energy to create a sound that is as imposing as it is eccentric.",

    "description": "Julia Blair is known for her ability to strike emotional chords her audiences didn’t realize were waiting to be hit. Her work lives at the coalescence of laugh-out-loud humor and acute melancholia, and it’s a rare show that doesn’t elicit tears from someone in the crowd.\n\nPraised by Pitchfork for her “smooth country alto”, Under the Radar described her sound as an exploration of the “broader world of chamber pop, soul, and gentle salves of singer/songwriter intimacy.” Graham Hunt has called her a modern-day Carole King. Some people look effortless on stage; Blair somehow pulls off the opposite trick. She doesn’t traffic in effortlessness– she performs with full-body earnestness that sings from the crown of her head down through her toes.\n\nHer new album, All of My Important Things, is out November 7 on Don Giovanni Records, examines our relationship to material possessions through the lenses of childhood memory, a secondhand blanket, and the enduring notion that a lifetime of accumulated shit can never match the wonder of the first little treasures we held as kids.",

    "description": "Julie Nolen is a Texas-based singer-songwriter whose music blends raw storytelling with the grit of rock & roll. Born under the wide-open skies of West Texas, her songs carry the dust of desert highways and the resilience of those who call them home. A proud voice in queer country, Julie brings authenticity to a genre rooted in tradition, proving that country music is for everyone.\n\nIn 2025, she was an official SXSW artist, showcasing her dynamic live performance. Now, she’s rolling out a five-song project leading up to a full EP drop in time for AmericanaFest in September. The lead single, “Love Me When I’m Leaving,” sets the tone for a collection of songs that explore the beauty and heartbreak of moving on.\n\nWhether playing an intimate acoustic set or leading a full band, Julie delivers music that’s as honest as it is powerful.\n\nLittle bit moody, little bit soulful country, a little in your face, unapologetic, bold.",

    "description": "\"Bruce Springsteen + Cocteau Twins = Junerise\" - KUTX\n\nJunerise is the heartland dream pop project of Austin-based, Utah-transplant singer-songwriter June Bennion, (They/Them).\n\nLooking ever skyward, June channels influences from the grounding story-centric songwriting chops of James Taylor and Bruce Springsteen to the ethereal gradient-scapes of The Cocteau Twins and Brian Eno with a dash of The Cure's dance-forward sensibilities. Their songwriting comes from a well of lived experiences growing up as a closeted queer person in the god-fearing Mormon mountain states.\n\nJune tackles feelings of isolation, wonder, and perseverance against the odds set against a sunset sky, quickly fading out of view as each song flows from scene to scene as each story is told. Junerise is a long incubated project which at times is downright danceable while also reveling in the beautiful transience of each passing moment.",

    "description": "The experimental art-rock collab of multi-instrumentalist creators Sam Maloney and Desiree Das Gupta, Kali Horse blends fantasy and harsh realism, colliding genres with reckless abandon. Production that dips between the best of alt-rock and avante-pop spheres, Kali Horse is a celebration of intentional genrelessness. Digital and live drums under emotional harmonies, swimming guitar enveloped by foley samples make the live band ripple with eccentricity. Their avante-pop whimsicality channels Björk, their soaring anthemic moments reflect their rock roots. The combo of Sam's feathery vocal and Des' powerhouse belt has their voices in conversation with one another - a hypnotic connection. The debut record 'Some Type of Electric Lagoon' (2023) is a vibrant metaphorical swamp journey, an opus. The new EP '2099' veers into industrial soundscapes - a bold snap back to reality. More bite and grit, with a higher polish than ever thanks to Emmy-winning foley artist Brandon Bak (Possum, OOZ). The live act lit up festivals like NYC’s New Colossus and Ontario's River & Sky, opening for and somehow making sense with SUUNS and Ruby Waters alike. Hypnotic. Psychedelic electronic. artrockbeats.",

    "description": "Karma Sheen is a London-based project led by British-Pakistani artist Sameer Khan, fusing the spirit of psychedelic rock with the emotional depth of Hindustani Classical music. Born from the tension between tradition and distortion, the project reimagines raag-based forms through fuzz pedals, improvisation and diasporic imagination.\nRooted in Khan’s training under Ustaad Latafat Ali Khan (Sham Chaurasi Gharana), Karma Sheen translates classical ornamentation into immersive soundscapes. Khan is joined by guitarist Amad Chima, sitarist Rodrigo Bourganos, bassist and visual artist Grisha Grebbenikov, and drummer/DJ Arun Dhanjal, forming a collaboration that bridges ancient lineage with contemporary subculture.\nThe band released their debut album in 2023, followed by extensive UK and European touring, including sold-out headline shows at Rich Mix and the 100 Club, and festival appearances at Shambala and Trans Musicales, where they recorded a KEXP live session due for release in early 2026.\nNow working with EBB Music, Karma Sheen are building international momentum as they prepare to release their second album in 2026.",

    "description": "Born in 2001, Philadelphia ignited its very own genre-bending firecracker: Kayanne Peppa. Also known as “Bunnii,” Kayanne began her creative journey at a young age, exploring various arts, writing, orchestra, & musical theater. Her curiosity later expanded into cosplay/design, & music laying the foundation for the bold world she creates today. Inspired by her brother, she began recording her own raps on GarageBand in high school, transforming a playful hobby into something more. Her music now emerges from the depths of fearless self-expression, blending hip-hop grit, punk rebellion & an unmistakable sense of play. With her animated and striking stage confidence, Kayanne Peppa turns every performance into an experience. Being instantly recognizable for her bunny ears, each show she lovingly gives them out to honor the memory of her beloved bunny, Kirby.Drawing inspiration from artists like Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Michael Jackson, Avril Lavigne, Gwen Stefani to name a few, she refused to stay in one lane. To her life is one big anime, where exaggeration, bold looks, and unapologetic individuality are quite essential.Kayanne Peppa’s music is made for main characters only!",

    "description": "Kety Fusco is electro-acoustic harpist, composer, and producer who has redefined the harp for the contemporary stage. Armed with her 47-microphone electro-acoustic harp, distortion pedals, and electronics, she transforms the instrument into a visceral voice that screams, whispers, and resonates far beyond classical tradition.\nHer debut album The Harp was selected by Iggy Pop as “best album” on BBC Radio 6, and in 2025 she will release BOHÈME (A Tree in a Field Records), featuring a collaboration with Iggy Pop. Fusco has toured extensively across Europe and Latin America, performing at prestigious venues such as the Royal Albert Hall, Montreux Jazz Festival, and Mexico’s CENART, and as a Swiss cultural ambassador at the Euro Jazz Festival (Mexico City) and South America tour for Swiss Embassies.\nIn 2025, she has also been invited by the U.S. Department of State to participate in the prestigious International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), recognizing her as an ambassador of Swiss music and cultural innovation.\nHer work bridges classical training and radical experimentation, from reimagining Beethoven’s “Für Elise” as a furious electronic cry to composing soundtracks for film and RAI Radio3. With over 200 live shows in three years, Kety Fusco is carving an unprecedented path for the harp in electronic music.",

    "description": "Kids is an art punk project focused on writing the most subversive music possible within tight limitations. Their sound is characterized by a lack of effects pedals, idiosyncratic arrangements and song forms, and an irreverent high energy that contrasts with their relatively minimal sound. The crown jewel of Kids is in the double vocals: All of their music relies on meticulous interplay between Venezuelan guitarist Julio Prato and bass player Ani Kramer on the vocal front, reimagining the idea of a song as more of a conversation between lead vocalists rather than the highlight of just one. All this is laid atop a flurry of cutting edge guitar work, grounding bass lines, and the one-of-a-kind surgical manner of drumming Colin Ferguson always brings to the table.\n\nTheir debut full length album REPETITIOM VARIATIOM released in the summer of 2024 is their most ambitious release to date, relying on disorientation, indulgently varying repetition, evocative imagery, and their signature sound palette to conceive music that feels familiar, humorous and encouraging, yet pronouncedly uncanny.",

    "description": "With a name as regal as their ambition, KNO are reshaping boundaries as they set out to release their debut album in April 2026.\n\nThis charismatic trio built their reputation through relentless touring and a catalogue of singles that bristle with both confidence and vulnerability.\n\nGlistening guitar riffs, punchy rhythms and poetic narratives ensure their sound is both urgent and heartfelt.\n\nThese narratives are channelled into lyrics that are as revealing as they are relatable.\n\nThe songwriting is a testament to their roots. Each track is a vignette of life, steeped in nostalgia, resilience and a yearning to belong. It’s music that’s as much about catharsis as it is about connection.\n\nFirst single ‘Transgressions’ is a confessional anthem. Nostalgia and identity are painted vividly in the second single as the band retrace childhood, its warmth underpinning an unflinching honesty.\n\nYet it’s the title track which lies at the emotional heart of this debut. Empathy is portrayed as both gift and curse, a force that connects deeply to others’ pain, yet at times threatens to overwhelm.\n\nIt’s a debut album that’s as unguarded and unflinching as the band themselves, sure to resonate with anyone whose heart has ever felt too full.",

    "description": "KOAD has one goal as an artist: “I want to make men cry and women dance.” The 23-year-old rapper, producer, and director from the San Fernando Valley is redefining Indian-American artistry with his debut album TREEHOUSE. Born Ajay Dodani to Indian immigrant parents, KOAD blends Bollywood nostalgia, hip-hop, and pop into something unmistakably his own. Teaching himself to produce at 13 and leaving school at 14 to pursue music full-time, he transformed his family garage into a studio with his brother and manager, Amit. His breakout single “Deepika” — a cheeky love letter to Bollywood icon Deepika Padukone — earned co-signs from SZA, Isaiah Rashad, Zane Lowe, and the actress herself. He followed with “dirty,” a sharp satire on cultural fetishization that amassed over 25M views and marked his directorial debut. Now signed to 10K Projects, KOAD is also the co-founder of KOGO, an artist community home to prolific originals including Asha Imuno, Curtis Waters, REHMA, CONNIE, Nafeesisboujee & more. With TREEHOUSE, he fuses vulnerability, swagger, and imagination into a world built for people to feel, dance, and belong.",

    "description": "KOJ is the sound of defiance rising from Liverpool, UK: a working-class voice turned outward, loud enough to cut through the noise, resilient enough to remain unshaken, and connected enough to represent a frustrated generation.\n\nDrawing from the raw British sub-cultural sounds of Grime, Rap and Punk, KOJ creates music that confronts power while rooted in relatability and everyday struggle. Revolutionary in spirit yet populist in appeal, his music is built to connect, move, and be felt collectively. At its core is courage - raw, direct lyricism exploring survival and defiance, darkness and light, pressure and pride.\n\nKOJ showcased his lyrical authority on his acclaimed debut EP Villain With A Conscience, earning support from Clash, Wonderland, The Face, Apple Music and Amazon Music.\nLive is where KOJ reaches another level. He doesn’t perform - he leads. From Boomtown to Radio 1 Big Weekend, Reeperbahn and SXSW, his shows become charged, communal moments where tension turns to release.\n\nMore than a catalogue, KOJ is building a movement through purpose-driven visuals, tech-led collaborations and his growing TRiBE community — “a man on a mission,” as The F-Word Magazine puts it.",

    "description": "Born and raised Austinite Kydd Jones is described by the Austin Chronicle as a \"longtime linchpin of Austin hip-hop\" that Texas Monthly says \"has been representing the city for years.\" The producer/singer-songwriter has written with and produced for artists like Kirko Bangz and Gary Clark Jr with a festival resume that includes the Billboard Hot 100 Fest at Jones Beach in New York; the Art of Rap Fest at Lakewood Amphitheater in Atlanta, Georgia; the Brooklyn Hip-Hop Festival; and NXNE in Toronto.\n\nWith collaborations with Central Texas staples like the Round Rock Express baseball team and Austin FC under his belt, Jones has stamped himself as one of the rising faces of the Texas music scene. His local NPR station affiliate, KUTX, has said about him, \"You’ll be listening to a track that sounds like early-’00s-era Madvillain one minute and the next you’ll hear one that evokes an aura not unlike modern day Frank Ocean,\" and his Austin American-Statesman has called him \"a lyrical ace who's spent over half his life spitting rhymes in Austin and beyond.\"",

    "description": "La Texana, the music project of José Ramírez, was born in 2021 in Tijuana, Baja California. At 17, with just a laptop and guitar, he began recording music inspired by Spanish alternative rock and post-punk influences. He debuted with Nunca He Sabido Amar, and in 2023 released his first EP, Morro, featuring Un Día Como Hoy, now with over 6.5 million streams. In 2025, La Texana released his first full-length album, signed by the spanish label Sonido Muchacho \"La Casa Que Cae\", a 10-track record exploring identity and new beginnings, reaching over 8 million streams. It includes standout tracks like Terco, El Sol, and Dispara. In May, he performed a sold-out debut at Lunario of Auditorio Nacional and is now touring across Mexico (40+ cities) and 7 countries, with more dates to come. La Texana is currently preparing for his biggest show yet at Teatro Metropólitan in February 2026. His style continues to evolve, blending vulnerability and nostalgia, while connecting with a new generation of Mexican musicians and growing an international audience.",

Raised singing with her siblings and performing in theater, her Puerto Rican-Dominican and African American heritage shaped her diverse musical influences and passion for honest storytelling. She wrote her first song at age 10 while backstage at The Lion King on Broadway, where she performed as Young Nala, and later appeared on American Idol.\n\nAfter taking time to reconnect with her faith and artistic direction, Lee returned in 2023 with her single “My Bad,” which gained traction following a bilingual a cappella performance on Kai Cenat and Speed’s livestream. In early 2024, her breakout single “Teach Me” went viral on Instagram and TikTok ahead of release, earning her first Billboard chart entries, including #2 on Gospel Digital Song Sales and #21 on Hot Gospel Songs.",

    "description": "Leo Von Sol is a pop and R&B artist based in Austin, Texas, pairing sleek pop songwriting with R&B phrasing, and a lower baritone vocal presence. Influenced by artists like Tinashe, KAI of EXO, and Omar Apollo, his work blends polished performance instincts with a cinematic visual sensibility and modern production choices. His recent EP, Garden of Sol, is focused on themes of nostalgia, temptation, and solitude, expressed through bright pop and R&B sonics and sun-rich visuals that draw from early-2000s pop language without feeling like a throwback. A Recording Academy member, Leo Von Sol balances candid, behind-the-scenes authenticity with a professionally branded presence, while his style sits at the intersection of luxury streetwear and high fashion, always intentional, elevated, and lived-in.",

    "description": "One of France’s most distinctive a cappella acts, Les Itinérantes turn three voices into an immersive, ritual-like live experience.\n\nLes Itinérantes (french for \"The Wanderers\") are one of France’s most acclaimed a cappella trios, recognized for transforming vocal performance into a powerful live experience. Founded in Paris in 2017, the group was born from a chance encounter and a shared desire to explore the voice beyond established genres.\n\nWithout instruments, they approach singing as a living, embodied material - a space of memory, transmission, and human connection. Their repertoire spans over nine centuries of music and more than fifty languages, blending ancient and traditional songs with original compositions. This diversity is not encyclopedic, but intentional: a search for what unites people across time, cultures, and borders.\n\nPraised by the French press for the ritual, purity, and emotional depth of their performances, Les Itinérantes are known for rare vocal precision and a strong sense of presence. Their concerts are intimate and immersive, offering audiences a focused, shared experience of listening.",

    "description": "Lew Apollo is a rising force in modern soul, captivating audiences with his soul-stirring melodies and poignant songwriting. KUTX praised him as “the perfect summer vibe,” a fitting description for an artist whose music blends hypnotic guitar, cinematic production, and a sultry, smoky voice into lush, resonant soundscapes. Originally hailing from rural Barnum, MN, Lew’s artistry is deeply rooted in his home state’s heritage, fusing the legacies of Bob Dylan and Prince with modern influences like Hozier, Leon Bridges, and Labrinth.\nThe tragic loss of his father in 2022 profoundly shaped Lew’s songwriting, catalyzing a body of work that confronts themes of grief, isolation, and resilience while offering hope and connection. His debut EP JUNGLE, produced by BLK ODYSSY, introduced him as a bold new voice and fueled a run of sold-out shows at iconic Austin venues like The Pershing and Antone’s.\nSince then, Lew has taken his music to wider audiences, touring in support of Los Lonely Boys and earning airplay on KUTX with his single “Diamonds and Gold” as well as “Let the Light In” from his debut album. Self-produced from start to finish, Fool’s Gold has already surpassed 300,000 streams in under two months and is creating buzz for its fearless vulnerability and lush production. Press outlets have echoed the excitement: AMP Music declared “Lew Apollo will be a force in the R&B and pop stratospheres. Be warned,” while Earmilk praised how “Apollo’s signature smoky voice sets the tone for a sultry soundscape.” With his clear vision and unwavering dedication to using music as a vessel for healing, Lew Apollo is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting new voices to watch in soul.",

A movement-first artist, she develops each song with choreography in mind—allowing ideas to travel from brain to body before they reach the stage. The result is cinematic, high-concept performance work merging storytelling, dance, fashion, and bold visual direction.\n\nShe released her debut EP Wild, But True in 2020, introducing audiences to her emotionally honest songwriting and performance-driven artistry. Since then, Lexaay has quickly emerged as one of the region’s most promising live performers, known for immersive showcases that blur the line between concert, dance production, and theatrical experience.\n\nHer work explores self-definition, desire, softness, and emotional complexity, presenting a multidimensional modern twenty-something perspective—bold, nostalgic, playful, spiritual, messy, and self-aware.\n\nWith her EP NEXT, Lexaay steps into a confident new era, redefining what urban pop can look and feel like.\n\nDynamic, intentional, and magnetic, she continues shaping her own lane.",

    "description": "Lightbath explores sound, space, and form through generative processes that treat the machine as collaborator. In the composer-as-gardener spirit, improviser and sound designer Bryan Noll plants musical seeds and guides them into pieces that unfold in the present moment.\n\n“Working with generative processes feels like a collaboration,” says Noll, “as if it’s alive and interacting with me. It’s an active meditation where I set the initial framework and listen, remaining agile enough to guide the musical conversation.”\n\nLightbath’s sound and process took shape through YouTube videos that capture the physical act of coaxing music from modular systems. Pitchfork described these “artfully unpretentious demonstrations” as a “strange, sui-generis niche,” calling them “part performance, part tech tutorial, and part audio-visual wallpaper.”\n\nNoll has released music on RVNG Intl and Seil Records and contributed music to series for Apple TV+ and SHOWTIME. His work has also appeared in campaigns for Apple, Coinbase, and Headspace. As a sound designer, he has created patches and presets for Moog Music, Novation/Focusrite, G-Force Software, and Polyend.",

    "description": "Lila Tristram is an evocative folk-rock artist, acclaimed for her atmospheric sound and striking lyricism. Her 2025 debut album, America, heralded as “genuine, brilliant art” by Line of Best Fit, marks a transformative chapter in Tristram’s creative journey, expanding her earlier bucolic folk style into a richer, elegiac folk-rock landscape.\n\nThe release of America has seen her social media following more than double and listenership grow tenfold. Partnering with Too Lost, her work has garnered over 400,000 streams, and received continuous support from BBC Radio 6, Soho Radio and BBC Introducing. Featured in over 50 publications and playlisted by Alex Rainbird, as well as Apple and Tidal editorial teams, Tristram is poised for her biggest year to date.\n\nShe has recently performed sold-out headline shows at St Pancras Old Church and Third Man Records, completed four tours in the UK and Europe, including a solo headline tour of southern Germany and a ten day UK support tour with Black Foxxes. She has recently returned from Rotterdam’s Left of the Dial Festival and is looking forward to making her debut performance in the USA at SXSW 2026.",

    "description": "Delivered from the West coast of Australia, Little Guilt arrive as a cocktail of honeyed vocals, hypnotic synths and wistful lyricism brought forth with driving guitars. Since their formation in early 2021, the indie outfit have unwittingly captured the hearts of music lovers in both the digital realm and on stage through sold-out venues around Australia.\n\nSince their debut, Little Guilt have supported Los Bitchos, Great Gable, Telenova, Old Mervs and more. They’ve earned acclaim from tastemakers including Tone Deaf, Frankie Magazine, Pilerats and Music Feeds, secured airplay across triple j, Double j, triple j Unearthed and community radio. The group were also showcasing artists at Bigsound 2024.\n\n2025 saw Little Guilt release two singles and join UK artist Freak Slug as the main support on their Australian national tour. The five-piece has kicked off this year supporting Nilüfer Yanya and showcasing at SXSW Austin. You can expect to hear new music from Little Guilt with their new 6-track EP releasing mid-2026.\n\nWith a subtle air of formidable cool and songs to sink your teeth into, it seems a little guilt goes a long way.",

    "description": "Little Wilderness is a dynamic, homegrown rock band that draws inspiration from the rugged landscape of Southwest Colorado, blending the raw energy of rock 'n roll with the unique environmental influences of the Four Corners region. Formed in 2011, the band has become a key player in Durango's music scene, with a lineup that includes Paul Henderson (guitar/singer), Dan Szabo (lead guitar), Juan Lopez (bass), and David Sachs (drums).\n\nTheir debut album, Big Tent (2019), released on Flak Records out of Austin, Texas, encapsulates their diverse sound. The album's opening track, “Crazy World,” is a high-octane composition that sets the tone with its fiery guitar riffs and driving rhythm. Other songs, like “Narrow Gauge,” incorporate elements of country and Americana, while tracks like “Laid Low” and “Starting New” showcase their indie rock sensibilities. The band’s style evokes the spirit of an era when garage bands ruled the airwaves, characterized by loud amps and hard-hitting drums.\nWith their blend of gritty rock 'n roll and Southwestern flavor, Little Wilderness proves that the genre is alive and well, and they’re here to keep it that way.",

    "description": "At 20, Texas-based artist Lola Kinsey is stepping fully into her own, blending classic rock roots with a modern pop shimmer. Her debut EP Come of Age captures the messy in-between of growing up. Heartbreak, family tension, and the pressure of figuring out who you’re supposed to be versus who you actually are.\n\nInspired by icons like Stevie Nicks, Cher, and Linda Ronstadt, Lola builds songs around strong melodies, big feelings, and a genre-bending spirit that feels both timeless and current. Ask her what genre she makes and she’ll still say “Linda Ronstadt,” a wink to her love of fearless storytelling and emotional honesty.\n\nMomentum continues to build: three tracks from her debut EP Come of Age have received radio play on KXT and 88.1 Indie, and she appeared as an official SXSW 2025 showcase artist. With a return to SXSW and a Jambaloo appearance in 2026, plus her debut album slated for release this year, Lola is ready to take over the world one disco at a time.",

    "description": "Seductive, sharp, and unapologetically fearless, Loren Heat is a bold new force in UK pop. Emerging from Middlesbrough in the industrial heartland of north east England, Loren wasted no time making waves with their debut EP “Scarlet Haze”.\n\nExploring the turbulence of admitting your feelings and experiencing some of your hardest points in life, Heat’s heart-on-sleeve lyrics combine the sweetest parts of love with the most vulnerable parts of lust.\n\nTheir sharp-edged pop has already caught the attention of major tastemakers including Clash, DIY, Spotify, Apple Music, BBC Introducing, Record of the Day, Notion, Atwood and Earmilk, to name but a few.\n\nInspired by global icons like Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Slayyyter, Dua Lipa and JADE, Loren is as unapologetic as their story – an exploration of queerness, identity and the raw chaos of navigating life in the North East.\n\nAfter a breakthrough 2025 which saw Heat perform acclaimed sets the likes of The Great Escape, Kendal Calling and BBC Introducing from the Glasshouse, Loren recently inked a deal with Interval Records (Generator/Universal Music Group).",

    "description": "Change doesn’t ask for permission; it disrupts and transforms. For Louie Lee, this truth began early. Growing up in a trailer park outside Detroit, he witnessed his mother working three jobs to make ends meet, instilling in him an unyielding work ethic. Battling a hearing impairment while soaking in the diverse sounds of metal, hip hop, rock, pop, and country, music became his escape and means of expression. The loss of his grandfather marked a turning point, igniting a new honesty in his songwriting that earned him Song of the Year at the Detroit Music Awards in 2022. Louie Lee's unique sound, labeled Country Hop & Roll, combines modern 808 basslines with country twang, crafting music that feels both grounded and dynamic. His lyrics delve into rarely explored emotional territories, balancing high-energy anthems with heartfelt ballads. Louie’s live performances forge deep connections with audiences, transforming shows into communal experiences where fans actively participate. As a storyteller, Louie is reshaping country music’s landscape, inviting non-country listeners to the genre while redefining its essence. His journey of creation through truth is just beginning.",

Her perfect control of rhythm and her body are evident in each of her tracks, from hip hop to dembow and even alternative. One thing is clear: LU is here to stay.\n\nUnder the Slowly label in collaboration with Angeles Mafia, LU's project promises to be the underdog of 2026.",

    "description": "Originally from the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina but currently living between LA, NYC and Richmond, VA; Lucaa (she/they) is the brainchild of singer/producer Stepha, who is a 2 spirit Afro-Indigenous artist whose genre-bending indie/alt-pop brand of music features raw and deceptively deep songwriting that pulls from their experiences as a young model in NYC, and being a queer BIPOC artist.\n\nAt a young age, Lucaa remembers listening to their father (who was a backup singer for Stevie Wonder, Earth Wind and Fire, and Michael Jackson) and mother (a trained opera singer). After teaching themself how to sing and play songs on piano by ear, Lucaa now takes a grungier approach to altpop, with influences harnessed from Radiohead, Billie Eilish, Willow, & girl in red.\n\nLucaa's career is growing quickly. A notable SXSW 2024 showcase early on led to major label interest and a fruitful year of performances and international branding campaigns with Leica Cameras and TurboTax. Lucaa was also a featured artist alongside Black Eyed Peas front man Taboo for Reserved Magazine, and appeared in Vogue Japan's October Edition (print), KEXP, Ones to Watch, and Them.",

    "description": "Kim Ho has escaped the clogged streets, blinding lights and noise of central Hong Kong to the region’s northern mountains. Heartbreak and disillusionment are on her heels.\n\nIn these mountains, in sight of both the Chinese border and the international hub of downtown Hong Kong, Ho seeks to make sense of who she, and her bandmates, are. The pride they’d felt as teenagers has long faded. Their multicultural progressive city has become politically oppressive since 2014, when anti-state protests were countered with beatings, politically-targeted arrests, and death threats from government officials. Says Ho, “we’ve been steadily losing hope for a decade now”.\n\nTheir response has been to create their own universe revolving around their studio practice space nestled in an unassuming industrial district on the edge of the city.\n\n'Instant Comfort' is the sound of a young band who've traveled the world, seen what it has to offer, held it for a moment, before watching it slip through their fingers. While the group’s first recordings arrived buoyant on a wave of hopeful romanticism, this latest outing is more complex; mapping their journey from uncertainty to a renewed sense of self-reliance.",

With a profound gift for dreaming up heavenly melodies and fantastically loose grooves, the Los Angeles native found his sound as part of a close-knit scene of young musicians and artists—a DIY-minded community whose spirit and sensibilities recall the near-mythic creative hotbed of early-’70s Laurel Canyon. Produced by Shooter Jennings (Brandi Carlile, Tanya Tucker) and Jonathan Wilson (Father John Misty, Angel Olsen), Luke’s debut body of work merges country-rock, folk-pop, and Southern soul into songs that immediately transport the audience into a state of enchanted ease.",

    "description": "Dubbed “UK music’s best kept secret” (Clash UK), drummer and producer Mackwood is rapidly emerging as one of the most exciting voices in the new wave of UK jazz and beyond. Cutting his teeth with Col3trane, Jim Legacy and ELIZA, and coming up through crossover projects like Silhouettes Project and Levitation Orchestra, Mackwood has carved out a distinctive niche between progressive jazz, beatmaking and alternative dancefloor rhythms. His sound fuses the pedigree of UK and international jazz with London’s new generation of player-producers, continuing the UK’s celebrated tradition of boundary-breaking crossover.\n\nNow stepping into the spotlight with his debut album MASTER CHANGES, he is cementing his reputation as a forward-thinking artist with global reach. With roots in jazz but a sound that bridges hip hop, electronic and bass culture, Mackwood’s music crosses scenes and audiences alike. His collaborations span both acclaimed names and rising talent, while his live energy and versatility are fast building him a worldwide reputation.",

    "description": "For over two decades, Marissa Nadler has carved out a singular place in the musical landscape, where ethereal folk, shadowy Americana, ambient soundscapes, and experimental textures converge. Anchored by her unmistakable mezzo-soprano and fingerstyle guitar, Nadler’s music conjures vivid emotional worlds—intimate, otherworldly, and timeless.\nA prolific songwriter, Nadler has built a discography defined by spectral beauty and haunting lyricism. Her songs, dreamlike and lush, are rich with imagery and nuance. Nadler released her debut album, Ballads of Living and Dying, in 2004, a collection that announced her as a major voice in the underground. A skilled visual artist as well, Nadler’s background in painting deeply informs the cinematic scope of her songs. Following her early work, she partnered with Sacred Bones and Bella Union for July (2014), marking a new chapter in creative clarity and critical acclaim. Strangers (2016), For My Crimes (2018), and The Path of the Clouds (2021) further expanded her sonic palette.\nHer 10th full-length, New Radiations, was released on August 15th. Expansive, melodic, and emotionally vivid, it captures Nadler at her most personal and visionary.",

    "description": "Born in Texas and raised in Northern California, Marley Hale’s musical influences followed: Texas’s deep, country and western swing roots met San Francisco’s folk and rock legends. The result: classic country tropes, turned on their heads through a switching of roles or a repossessed identity; delicate, revelatory explorations of what it means to be a friend, lover, or neither; and second person addresses to herself that offer both an onlooker’s and her own perspective. After California, Hale spent time in Austin, TX and Portland, OR before relocating to Brooklyn, NY, where she recorded her debut EP, By My Own Ways, released July 2024, and began touring the US and Canada. After spending the better part of three years on the road, she moved back home to Austin, where she now resides.",

The indie rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 2022, and consists of Nicolas Lara (vocals, guitar), and Michaela Gradstein (vocals, guitar). The project began as Lara’s solo work in Palm Springs, where he released the debut album Whiskey Girl, before evolving into a full band the following year.\n\nMarni intertwines heavy distorted guitars with beautifully soft moments, drawing on influences such as Title Fight, Greet Death, and Hovvdy. Their newest EP fml era (2025), produced by Corey Coffman of Gleemer, is a portrait of being down on your luck, with unpolished guitars, and emotionally direct storytelling.",

    "description": "Maya Manuela is an indie-pop artist originally from Duxbury, Massachusetts, raised on an oyster farm before relocating to Nashville in 2019 to pursue music full-time. Her work blends intimate, emotionally precise songwriting with warm, modern production—songs that feel confessional without losing their pop instincts.\n\nIn 2023, Maya gained viral traction with her breakout single “Multiverse,” sparking two East Coast tours, festival appearances including Levitate Music Festival and Musicians Corner, and support slots for artists such as Angie McMahon. Her momentum continued with her debut album American Doll (2025), a candid and self-aware body of work that explores desire, disillusionment, and identity with quiet confidence. Named Musicbed’s Artist of the Year in 2025, Maya Manuela has emerged as a compelling new voice in indie pop—equal parts tender, incisive, and unafraid to tell the truth.",

    "description": "You know that moment you realised Lady Gaga was named after a Queen song? MEEK is kind of the musical and stylistic culmination of that connecting glue, the secret chemical equation that bonds them. She is walking class war, musical defiance and the return of glam rock at its most instantly and commercially appealing. She’s dancing on the gay bar bar-top with a sparkler fizzing in your cocktail.\n\nMEEK is not a work in progress. She is fully formed, earned her stripes, comes from nothing, nepo-baby baiting execution of timeless pop brilliance. While sounding directly descended from the DNA of famed countercultural misfits and bona fide pop aces, all strewn across the decades, her music is a no messing, straight shoot for the top.",

    "description": "meg elsier is an indie-rock singer, songwriter, and visual artist based in New York City. One of the most exciting new voices in the indie-rock scene, meg juxtaposes sweet vocals and opulent melodies with grungy guitars and weighty production. Keen wit and self-awareness shine through her lyrics, seamlessly weaving into the fabric of her ethereal shoegaze sound.\n\nmeg's debut album 'spittake' blends elements of grunge, contemporary pop, folk, and indie-rock, and showcases meg’s ability to create dynamic, versatile, and effortlessly catchy music. Across the album’s 11 tracks, she delivers musings on love, death, nostalgia, youth, anxiety, depression and everything in between, with a uniquely self-deprecating touch. “The story isn’t necessarily linear,” she explains. “But the main connection throughout is this unreliable narrator that you as a listener determine your view/trust of. They are incredibly inconsistent with their statements but I believe they think they’re telling the truth.”",

    "description": "Mega Ran (Raheem Jarbo) is a GRAMMY-nominated rapper, author, and former middle school teacher whose career proves hip-hop has no boundaries. A pioneer of nerdcore, he blends sharp lyricism with education, storytelling, and pop culture — drawing inspiration from video games, comics, and professional wrestling.\n\nHis music has been licensed by Capcom and featured in major video games (Mortal Kombat 11, TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge), television (WWE, AEW), and film (Clerks III). He’s toured internationally, performed at Madison Square Garden, and he's produced an EMMY winning musical.\n\nIn 2022, becoming a foster parent inspired Mega Ran to expand into family music. His children’s albums Buddy’s Magic Toy Box and Buddy’s Magic Tree House topped Billboard and iTunes charts, earned major playlist support, and led to a GRAMMY nomination for Best Children’s Album.\n\nKnown for high-energy, all-ages performances, Mega Ran is just as comfortable rocking libraries and museums as he is festivals and wrestling rings. Living up to his “Teacher / Rapper / Hero” mantra, his mission remains simple: entertain, educate, and create spaces where everyone feels welcome.",

    "description": "Formed in the orbit of a South London pub, the spirit of Mên An Tol’s music can be traced back to frontman Bill Jefferson’s own musical education in his native Cornwall where he’d play folk sessions in and around the local pubs – in-fact the band name itself is taken from a rural site of ancient stones.\n\nThe band’s instant chemistry (completed by mandolinist Felix Knox, bassist Max Silvey, drummer Tom Stevens and guitarist Robert Wiseman) is writ-large as they channel the raw grit of folk greats like The Pogues and The Waterboys alongside the mainstage urgency and confidence of Britpop giants. Perhaps most vitally, the songs proudly reclaim lost folk traditions with the use of the mandolin coupled with vibrant storytelling.\n\nThe band released two EP's in 2025, the most recent being September's 'This Land’, featuring the track ‘Not Ideal’ - produced by Carlos O’Connell of Fontaines DC who got involved after seeing them live.\n\nThroughout the year Mên An Tol have gone from strength to strength. They've picked up praise from NME, Rolling Stone UK, The Independent, DIY, So Young and more. At radio the band were on the B List at BBC 6 Music with single 'Not Ideal' and recorded a Maida Vale session for Steve Lamacq. On his Apple Music radio show Elton John has given two different tracks a spin, stating \"I really love their sound\".\n\nThe band played two shows at 2025 Glastonbury Festival alongside European festival runs, UK touring and dates supporting The Libertines and Miles Kane. They also played The Great Escape and finished the year with a packed out London headline at The Lexington.",

    "description": "Michael The Lion is the latest and greatest pseudonym of long-time Philadelphia DJ and producer DJ Apt One. Michael's trademark sound features live instruments sitting seamlessly with sampled grooves to create organic, classic textures. The Lion sound is always funky, always strong and always ready for the floor.\n\nMichael was a part of the multi-genre style of DJing that catapulted his adopted Philadelphia to the pinnacle of the DJ world in the early 2000s. His years of seasoning as a DJ have seen him play all styles imaginable all across North America and Europe. As a part of the duo RCMP, his work foreshadowed the emergence of Nu-Disco before the genre even had a name. Now, as Michael The Lion, he is pushing the boundaries of funk in modern dance music.",

    "description": "Miguel Ortiz, nacido y criado en la ciudad de Austin Texas la capital de la música. De padres originarios de la cuna de la independencia nacional, Dolores Hidalgo Guanajuato. Vendió pan y chicles de niño para apoyar a sus padres económicamente. Desde joven edad el interés por la música se le notaba a este joven talento. Lo miraban imitando a uno de sus ídolos de la infancia, a José Guadalupe esparza. “Mi padre tenía un CD de bronco, recuerdo que la primera vez que lo escuche junto a el, fue algo inexplicable. Me enamore de cada tema, sentí algo tan bonito que no podia explicar; simplemente quise replicar lo que yo sentí al escucharlos a ellos, pero con mis temas. Las canciones del grupo bronco y mi padre fueron una gran inspiración para mi. Por mi padre, y por la música de Bronco hago música hoy”, dijo Miguel en una entrevista. Recibió su primer guitarra como un obsequio de su padre cuya única condición fue que aprendiera a tocar. Empezó a tocar la guitarra a los catorce años de edad. Miguel noto que el arte de componer se le dio muy naturalmente, y desde entonces a compuesto cada tema que saca. Hoy viene con un estilo único y fresco ofreciéndoles temas originales de su puño y alma",

    "description": "Born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in Sacramento, California, Antonio Smith, better known as Mission, is a genre-defying Christian music artist who has dedicated his life and music to glorifying God. As a husband to Shawnay Smith and father of four—two boys and two girls—Mission’s journey of faith began when he gave his life to Christ at the age of 18, and his music continues to reflect that commitment. Mission’s life and music are deeply rooted in Matthew 6:33: “Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” He believes in doing God’s will, not his own, and encourages others to love God’s people. His personal motto, “All of You, none of me,” is based on the scripture “I must decrease so the Lord can increase,” signifying his desire for God’s will to be done in his life above all else.",

    "description": "Modern Cinema Master is a four-piece band formed in Taipei, whose sound is heavily influenced by the independent rock of the 1990s. Their music is driven by sharp noise, post-punk energy, and lo-fi anthems.\n\nSince 2019, the band has remained true to its roots, focusing wholeheartedly on creation. To date, they have released two EPs, three singles, and two double-CD albums, amassing more than forty original songs. Their live performances are equally renowned, frequently selling out thousand-capacity venues in Taiwan and China. In 2025, they were invited to perform at the Incheon Pentaport Rock Festival in Korea, where they received an enthusiastic response.\n\nModern Cinema Master’s music is simultaneously raw and refined, pairing poetic, thought-provoking lyrics with a powerful sonic edge. Their track “I Want to Kill Romance and Murder Poetry” earned Taiwan’s most prestigious independent music award for Best Rock Song, with the jury praising it as “savagely precise, capturing the very essence of rock.”\n\nBlending fierce, driving melodies with blunt, hard-hitting lyrics, The Modern Cinema Masters fuse critique and irony into one powerful voice, a sound that captures the essence of our times.",

    "description": "Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary hardly need an introduction. Since the early 2000s, the East Berlin duo has evolved from local techno innovators into a globally established force. Along the way they founded Monkeytown Records, a creative hub that now spans their own releases and an eclectic roster of artists across genres.\n\nFriendship, openness and an unshakable curiosity have always defined MODESELEKTOR. Their sound has never stayed in one lane, diving headfirst into IDM, hip hop, UK bass, breaks, house and ambient. Collaboration has been equally essential. Their albums and live shows have featured artists like Thom Yorke, Tommy Cash, Flohio, Siriusmo, Blixa Bargeld, Iggor Cavalera, Catnapp, Otto Von Schirach, Paul St. Hilaire, Omar Souleyman, Anti Pop Consortium, Miss Platnum and many more. Bronsert and Szary have always created as one, rarely working separately.\nTheir work with Sascha Ring, aka Apparat, as Moderat opened an entirely new chapter, leading to sold-out tours and arena shows.

    "description": "MOIO doesn’t just make music, he commands emotion. In fact, the Nigerian- Irish singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist chases emotion with every lyric he pens, melody he sings, and beat, bassline, or guitar riff he plays. This pursuit has brought him to a space between genres, co-existing in the realms of R&B, indie, alternative, and soul—yet cleverly never committing to one above the other. By helming every aspect of his artistry, he’s able to operate fluidly, and his vision resonates across boundaries.\n\nGrowing up in Dublin, music called to MOIO as a child. His passion was fostered by church and the radio in equal measure. After taking piano lessons for several years, he taught himself guitar and bass. At 10-years-old, he sang live for the first time at school and fell in love with performing. Buzzing on Soundcloud with early uploads, he slowly but surely attracted an audience. Moio released His Debut EP \" Earthday\" October 3rd 2026.",

    "description": "Montclair is the Austin, Texas-based, independent folk-rock project resulting from four friends’ expression of joy and curiosity for life. Montclair's sound explores themes of self-discovery and emerging adulthood, from the beloved surf rock groove of “Pastel Lies” to the forlorn folk guitar wave in “Passing Through”. Their debut album, “Heart is Alive!” explores their musical potential and emotional range, both on full display in the first two singles, the titular and upbeat “Heart is Alive!” and the enigmatic rock powerhouse “Coming to the Rescue”. With a dynamic range of music, Montclair’s live performances are energetic and engaging, and they are known to have a strong crowd pull in Texas. Montclair has been invited to play onstage to crowds at festivals and iconic Texas venues such as House of Blues Houston, and a sold-out Antone's Nightclub, with nationally touring acts like Echosmith, The Brook and The Bluff, Dayglow, Giant Rooks, The Wldlfe, Briscoe, and many more. They look forward to the release of their debut album and the adventures and inspirations that await them ahead.",

    "description": "With combined streams of over 100 million and a dedicated online following, Morgan is doing things her way. Morgan began performing at just three years old and by eighteen she’d joined Rudimental as a globally-touring vocalist. Her solo debut ‘My Year’ spotlit her brand of sparkling pop, before a collaboration with Ebenezer (‘Mulholland Drive’) earned her over 10 million streams. Her subsequent EP ‘Alien’ referenced golden-era pop. That same year, ‘ADCT’ (written when she was 17) soared to the #1 spot on both TikTok Trending Sounds and the UK Top 50, earning over 30 million streams. Morgan also co-wrote and featured on Rudimental & Digga D’s ‘Be the One’, Sigma’s ‘Adrenaline Rush’ and Purple Disco Machine's most recent album. She’s been writing for some of the biggest K-pop artists (including NCT’s Jaehyun, TWICE & Aespa).\n\nMorgan released her EP ‘Emotional Gangster’ last October and went on to sell out her first UK headline tour at the end of the year including a show at London’s iconic Jazz Cafe. She turned up the heat with the release of ‘One Man’ featuring the legendary Beenie Man, paired with the unapologetic anthem ‘Bad Gyal Energy’.",

Inspired by tumbados but influenced by pop, trap, and urban melancholy, his music is honest, unfiltered, and deeply personal.\n\nBuilt without shortcuts or backing, MOSMO represents a generation raised on Peso Pluma, Natanael Cano, and Junior H, while carving a lane entirely his own.\nHe’s not chasing virality. He’s building something real",

    "description": "There’s something about MURTY’s voice that sounds like a storyteller who can flirt, argue, and get in his feelings all within the same breath. He slides between smooth R&B, natural soul instincts, and unfiltered honesty. His songs feel like late-night confessions, unsent texts, and the confidence it takes to say what most people only think.\n\nHe sings with intention. There’s humor in the pain, soul in the simplicity, and zero interest in staying in one lane. MURTY isn’t here to sound perfect. He’s here to sound like himself, flaws, feelings, and all. He's not just making music. He’s making moments you laugh at, relate to, and secretly replay.",

    "description": "egüs Fresh is an American artist, creative influencer, real estate investor, and entrepreneur born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Once a full-time basketball player, Fresh stepped into music in 2017 after facing life-altering challenges that reshaped his path. Committed to protecting his mental health and purpose, he began creating storytelling-driven rap rooted in real-life experiences — what he calls his personal journal entries.\n\nKnown for his smooth, melodic lifestyle sound, Fresh blends cool, player perspective with spiritual growth while staying grounded in his Detroit roots. His music ranges from motivational reflections to laid-back lifestyle records, painting vivid pictures over soulful production inspired by artists like Nipsey Hussle, Jay-Z, Dom Kennedy, and Curren$y.\n\nDetroit-born and purpose-driven, Negüs Fresh delivers music that reflects growth, resilience, and elevated perspective through real-life storytelling.\n\n“Music saved my life. I was in a very dark place, and it gave me a way to release everything I held inside — turning my darkest moments into stories meant to inspire.”",

    "description": "With a delicate sound carrying the weight of an old soul, néomí’s stripped-back style blends the lush ambience of contemporary indie-pop artists like Justin Vernon and Julia Jacklin with the troubadour flair of sixties protest folk. Growing up in an environment that offered little stimulation, néomi spent much of her time observing. This inner reflection revealed two wolves: the old school folk artist, and the contemporary indie-pop artist. On her upcoming releases, they find a place to co-exist.\n\nFollowing the emotional resonance of her acclaimed 2025 EP ‘Another Year Will Pass’, néomí opens a bold new chapter with ‘Didn’t I’, a track that captures the helpless weight of being made to carry someone else’s chaos in a fractured relationship. With her signature blend of ethereal folk and cinematic pop minimalism, néomí channels a quiet but cutting heartbreak, soaked in introspection and raw lyricism.",

Her catalog, including HEAL (2023), Medicine Music (2024), and Medicine Music II (2026) reflects her commitment to collective restoration, emotional liberation, and reclaimed joy. On stage, her performances become multisensory experiences blending music, poetry, and hella swag.\n\nShe is also Founder of the non-profit, Nu Indigo Nation, cultivating safe, self-sustaining futures for Black people through art, education, and wellness.",

Formed in Manchester UK in 2023, their music captures the anxious beauty of city life after hours—dripping in atmosphere - bass-heavy and emotionally raw. With haunting vocals, reverb-soaked guitars, and minimalist beats, they echo the ghosts of The Knife, Portishead, early Cure, Chromatics and the XX, all while carving out a space all their own.\n\nThe early demos caught the ears of tastemaker label and magazine So Young, who released two 7\"s from the band, one in 2023 and another in 2024 - both selling out with champions at BBC R1 and 6 Music, The Guardian, NME, The Fader, Brooklyn Vegan, The Line Of Best Fit, Dummy, DIY + Dork supporting the singles.\n\nUnderground shows followed leading to festival appearances at Left Of The Dial, Blue Dot, Manchester Psychfest and Float Along, headline shows at Supersonic in Paris, Manchester and London and support shows with Rock Action signings Bdrmm across the UK.\n\nNightbus released their debut album 'Passenger' on Melodic records, October 2025 to critical acclaim.",

    "description": "Nashville-based singer-songwriter Nikki Gold grew up half country, half city—riding horses one day, chasing urban rhythms the next—and has lived across the U.S. and the UK. Her voice, part modern Joni Mitchell with a subtle Celtic bend, cuts with honesty that resonates.\n\nWith years helping people navigate pain, transformation, and life’s messy edges, Nikki turns love, dating, and self-discovery into songs that stick, sting, and uplift—all with a wink of humor. Produced by John D. Willis (Taylor Swift, Kenny Chesney, Shania Twain), her upcoming EP Maverick—with its title single released in February 2026—captures the electric space between who you were and who you’re becoming.\n\nThrough her “2nd VERSE” series and live shows, Nikki creates music that grabs, shakes, and inspires—a soundtrack for the next chapter",

    "description": "Nilipek. is a Berlin-based Turkish singer-songwriter whose delicate yet powerful sound has shaped the landscape of Turkish alternative music for the last decade. Her performances blend delicate, breathy vocals with moments of raw intensity; creating an atmosphere that shifts between vulnerability and bursts of noise.\n\nReleasing her long-awaited fourth album, Uydurduğumuz Oyunlarla (“The Games We Made Up”) digitally in May 2024 and on vinyl in January 2025, she delivered her most intricate and emotionally resonant work yet. The tracks promise the listener a forty-five-minute uninterrupted journey while combining political symbolism in lyrics with innovative musical arrangements. The album also elegantly portrays Nilipek.’s musical evolution since her first album in 2015.\n\nThis year, the Turkish singer-songwriter is releasing her first fully English single, Safe Coast, in collaboration with the producer Cody Fitzgerald (Stolen Jars). The song captures the search for meaning and security in an ever-shifting, and increasingly perilous world, while creating a sanctuary in its sound.",

    "description": "Olivia Ellen Lloyd will try anything once. From flight attendant school in Dallas to producing theater in New York City and teaching in Guatemala, Lloyd sought an adventurous life, but struggled to find a greater sense of purpose. That is, until she found her way back to music. Lloyd channels her restless spirit into songs that pay homage to her Appalachian roots while charting fresh territory for a sound that is uniquely her own.\n\nHeavily influenced by country, folk, and indie rock, Lloyd’s sound combines the rooted sounds of her traditional Appalachian upbringing with the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants nature of her current life. She is inspired by the rich sounds of New York City, the peaceful quiet of her small West Virginia hometown, and life on the road in between.\n\nHer 2025 sophomore record \"Do It Myself\" landed her debut appearances at Mountain Stage, Americana Fest, and Brooklyn Folk Festival and her debut album, Loose Cannon, has been streamed over 1 million times while Olivia has been busy crossing the country opening for artists like Kelsey Waldon, Tommy Prine, and Jobi Riccio, winning songwriting contests (Kerrville in 2023), and generally eating life down to the rind.",

She has toured the world performing with Grammy- winning rock, pop, and country acts, using her experiences in varied musical contexts to perfect her own sound. As a solo artist born in Manhattan, NY, the songs she writes and the way she sings them are steeped in the jazz tradition that she picked up during her high school days at jazz clubs in Manhattan, but with an indie pop spin. Many of her lyrics reflect her experiences on the road, and she has built a loyal following online through her presence on the scene as a writer and musician. Liv has also toured her own project throughout the US; her latest EP “Return to Sender” is a culmination of her past few years of adventure, heartbreak, and growth.",

    "description": "“Music will never stop evolving, and I will continue to grow with it.” ~Oscar Ortiz\n\nBorn into an artistic family of Regional Mexican artists, Oscar Ortiz is the youngest of four leading artists in the genre: Gerardo, William, and Kevin Ortiz. However, Oscar shines on his own with his youthful style and talent as a composer, fusing cumbia and ballads with modern corridos.\n\nHis solo music began to transcend borders with the singles “El Del C8” (2023) and “FIRST LOVE” (2024) with Edgardo Núñez; the latter catapulting him onto the global scene with over 200 million streams on Spotify, a No. 1 spot on Billboard Regional Mexican Airplay, platinum certifications, and virality on TikTok.\nThis phenomenon was followed by other songs that consolidated his musical identity, such as \"ALVRGZO\" (with Alex Favela and Código FN), \"Anillos\" (with Oscar Maydón), \"Modo Bélico\" (with Polo González), \"23/7,\" and \"Ice Cream\" (with Los Mismos de la M).\n\nOscar Ortiz didn't stop there. In 2025, he continued to reap hits like \"Y Si Te Vas,\" a single released with Carin León, which peaked at #5 and is currently #7 on Billboard's Regional Mexican Airplay charts. Additionally, he has other songs released this year, such as “Aplauso” with Matisse, “AMIGOS PARA QUÉ”, “CARO,” and soon “LAST KISS” which will be released in October 2025. Added to this is his biggest project to date: his first studio album, projected to be released in January 2026. In Oscar's words, this project brings “a lot of love and heartbreak… corridos, versatile sounds, a little bit of everything,” in addition to collaborations with artists from different regional currents.",

    "description": "Blending folktronica with and leftfield pop, the duo Our Shame (凹與山) consists of producer/singer-songwriter Estelle H and percussionist Isan, seeks something spiritual in the modern day technology addiction from an East Asian perspective.\n\nTheir debut album ‘Modern Problem’, an independently produced fusion of electro-folk and retrowave, the album has earned recognition from music editors across Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia, finding its way into many curated playlists and Spotify Viral 50. On their second album, ‘Hidden Album’(2025), Our Shame approach it like wallflowers at an underground rave, documenting the unspeakable with a quiet but unflinching lens. Built on a foundation of folktronica and synth-pop, their palette stretches from acoustic guitars and field recordings to splashes of Trip-hop, UK Garage and techno.\n\nWith a unique mix of soulful vocals, synthesizers, guitars, drum machines, their sound fuses the cold textures of digital precision with the warmth of analog tones. The duo has performed at notable events like Reeperbahn Festival 2024 (Germany), Minami Wheel (Japan), Megaport Festival (Taiwan) and Sonik Philippines.",

Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and Nipsey Hussle. What began as inspiration evolved into intention as Ozer matured—transforming lived experience into honest, reflective songwriting grounded in execution, flow, and substance. Following the release of his latest EP Fog City, he has shared stages with Westside Boogie, Topaz Jones, Trayce Chapman, YGTUT, and more, solidifying his presence as a formidable and thoughtful emcee. A writer at heart and performer by nature, Ozer uses language as a lyrical canvas, drawing from the essence of real life to create music that resonates with clarity, purpose, and lasting impact.",

    "description": "P.H.0 [P-H-\"zero\"] is a NYC-based SILKPUNK quartet reshaping the city's underground. Fusing the raw, intense metal riffs with the haunting cry of the traditional Chinese erhu and techno-dystopian synths, they craft sounds that are at once chaotic and controlled, futuristic and ancient. Their live shows—referred to as \"rituals\"—transform ancient Taoist traditions into ear-crushing soundscapes that defy time, crashing into chaotic mosh pits under visceral strobing lights to create what some describe as a rave in an abandoned shrine from Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nTheir momentum has carried them from NYC festivals like New Colossus and Punk Island to sold-out shows across the East Coast, proving their reach in every environment—from the historic Gramercy Theatre, where they were handpicked by Danish prog-metal giants VOLA to support their North American tour, to inside an abandoned tunnel where they performed for more than 500 ravers. They were further recognized by NPR's Tiny Desk as a top 50 \"Top Shelf\" artist in 2025, and by Bandcamp Daily, who praised their debut album KARMA for “reimagining what Asian music might sound like.” P.H.0 continues to build a cult following, one ritual at a time.",

The stories are his, but the feeling they convey — love, loneliness, lust, and so on — are, hopefully, still universal.",

    "description": "If there's one thing Panic Shack know, it's how to have a good time. Comprised of Sarah, Meg, Romi, Em and Nick, the band formed in 2018 as a middle-finger to the “members-only club” atmosphere of indie and punk scenes – not just because they’re male-dominated, but because they make playing music seem out of reach or, even worse, boring.\n\nThis carefree approach gives Panic Shack’s music the same effect as popping a bottle of Prosecco – explosive, intoxicating, and delightfully chaotic. With barely any music available online, they built a word-of-mouth following off the back of their live shows, which have been praised for fusing “thrashy early LA-style punk with choreography that owes something to the Go-Go’s and Iron Maiden all at once” (The Guardian).Released in 2022, their acclaimed Baby Shack EP bottled the lightning they have on stage, cementing their ability to blend killer hooks with a contagious sense of humour.\n\nReleased in July 2025, Panic Shack’s self-titled debut album represents a serious level up. It finds the band expanding their gutsy punk sound into fuller territory, packed with vocal harmonies, synths and electronic experimentation.",

    "description": "(New album DREAMERS BELIEVERS ILLUSIONISTS PREACHERS out in November 2025)\nPär Hagström has always moved along the outer edges of music – from the first stumbling chords on his family’s pump organ in Huskvarna, through 90s death metal and 70s hard rock, to the innermost heart of gospel. It’s a journey shaped as much by philosophy, literature, and theater as by rock clubs and church halls, eventually arriving at a universe of its own where drama and soulful preaching merge into one.\nAs a frontman, Hagström is as much a preacher as he is a singer. His voice carries a natural theatrical force – raspy and silky at the same time – with an instinctive readiness to let the music chafe, sweat, and hypnotize. Drawing inspiration from Tom Waits, Led Zeppelin, Mavis Staples and the Blind Boys of Alabama, and together with his band Charlatans of Love, he has in recent years shaped a new musical entity where gospel, soul, psychedelic rock, and funk meet in something as seductive as it is uncompromising.\n\nDREAMERS BELIEVERS ILLUSIONISTS PREACHERS is a continuation of the mini-album The End Again (2024), picking up where the story left off.",

    "description": "Patriarchy is the Los Angeles industrial pop duo of Actually Huizenga and AJ English, exploring sex, power, subversion, and death where desire and fear collide. Known for chaotic, boundary-pushing live performances that dissolve the line between performer and audience, the band fuses infectious electronic pulse with industrial metal, distorted synths, and spoken-word intensity.\n\nSince their breakout releases Asking For It and The Unself, Patriarchy sharpened their sound into something harder and more immediate on 2025’s Manual for Dying, produced in collaboration with Twin Shadow. The album drives their industrial roots deeper into dark club territory while amplifying their theatrical edge.\n\nTheir live reputation has carried them from the experimental extremity of Roadburn Festival to the indie forward energy of Wide Awake Festival, the darkwave revivalism of Cruel World Festival, and the metal intensity of Brutal Assault — proving Patriarchy move seamlessly between underground art spaces and large-scale international stages.\n\nAt SXSW 2026, they arrive sharper than ever.",

    "description": "Pei-Yu Hung is a Taiwanese vocalist and multidisciplinary performer whose work bridges pop, performance art, and contemporary theater. Born in Kaohsiung and based in Taipei, she approaches music through a “body-based performance” philosophy, integrating dance, voice, and visual storytelling to expand the expressive range of modern pop. Her collaborations span independent musicians, theater troupes, and experimental artists, making her one of Taiwan’s most versatile and forward-thinking performers.\n\nIn 2022, Pei-Yu released her debut album ‘Silver Lining’ , a ten-track journey through light and shadow, personal reflection, and emotional subtlety. The album earned eight nominations at the Golden Melody Awards, winning Best New Artist. In 2023, her song “The Same” (同款), the theme for the film ‘Day Off’ won Best Original Film Song at the Golden Horse Awards.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the most accomplished female vocalists in the Mandarin-speaking music scene over the past decade, Pei-Yu Hung continues to define contemporary Mandarin-language music with her distinctive voice and artistry. Seamlessly moving between lyrical pop and avant-garde soundscapes, she merges experimentation with expressive depth, redefining contemporary Mandarin music and bringing a bold, fresh dimension of Taiwanese sound to the global stage.\n\nPei-Yu released her highly anticipated second album ‘Still Moving’ in October 2025, featuring collaborations with artists from Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. For the new single “It's Nothing Personal”, she enlisted Polish director Chris Rudz, who previously directed dance videos for Japanese artist Fujii Kaze, to helm the music video, with choreography created in collaboration with Japanese choreographer Chikako Takemoto, showcasing a dynamic cross-border, cross-disciplinary creative energy.",

    "description": "On their intoxicating new album, Thank the Lord...it’s The Pink Stones, Pinkston and his bandmates do precisely that, offering up a joyful, adventurous take on ’60s twang that blurs the lines between cosmic country, folk, bluegrass, soul, and psychedelic rock. Recorded once again with co-producer/engineer Henry Barbe (Drive-By Truckers, Deerhunter) in the band’s hometown of Athens, GA, the collection showcases a more deliberate, mature side of The Pink Stones’ sound, one that reflects all the personal and sonic growth that’s defined the last few years for the hard touring five-piece. The songs on Thank the Lord... are humble and timeless, full of wry, sardonic wit and rich, evocative storytelling, and the performances are easygoing and amiable, with an effortlessly natural feel that belies the masterful craftsmanship behind them. The result is a record that wears its influences proudly on its sleeve, even as it a subverts expectation, a work of poignant longing and playful humor that tips its cap to everyone from Merle Haggard and Earl Scruggs to Don Williams and The Byrds as it looks both forwards and backwards all at once.",

    "description": "Poiison is an innovative artist and songwriter from Queens, NY, blending melodic hip-hop, Latin rap, and R&B into a sound uniquely her own. A proud product of New York City, she’s built real momentum—opening for 50 Cent, touring with Shordie Shordie, and completing a 6-city run with Kevin Gates. Her collaborators include Styles P, 2Rare, Fergie Baby, Cash Cobain, and Sha Money XL.\n\nHer musical roots began in church with her mother and were shaped by her sister, a professional drummer. By fifth grade, she was already commanding stages—early signs of the presence she carries today. That spark has grown into a dedicated fan base and touring draw, marking her as an artist with conviction and connection.\n\nIn 2025, she released two standout EPs—Pretty Pain and Love Money Art—showcasing her duality: vulnerable yet bold, melodic yet raw. Inspired by icons like Madonna, Sade, Rick James, Lil Wayne, and more, Poiison channels a wide palette into a sound that lives outside the mold.\n\nIn 2026, she enters a defining chapter with La Madrina Vol. 2, a project blending originals with standout freestyles over today’s hottest beats — setting the stage for her most impactful year yet.",

    "description": "IF YOU STOP YOU DIE -\n\nRock n’ Roll will never be a lazy game. PONS is here to set the record straight.\n\nChanneling the wild, untamable spirit of the masters of the road that came before them, PONS brings a relentless, “NO MERCY” approach to DIY touring. Burning more calories in one night than most bands do in a year, PONS doesn’t play just music—they detonate on stage\n\nTaking cues from the anarchic swagger of Iggy Pop and the electronic chaos of Suicide, frontperson Jack Parker spits the digital bile of our decaying, internet-saturated world straight in your face. It’s a new noise pop for the modern age.\n\nWith their dashing look and salesman’s eye, PONS has supported notable acts such as Gogol Bordello, Lambrini Girls, A Place To Bury Strangers, Laura Jane Grace, Geese, Vundabar, Frankie and the Witch Fingers, and more.\n\nBEAR WITNESS TO PONS.",

He pioneered this genre alongside DJ King Louie as part of the duo Royal Highness. Honoring his family’s musical legacy, he continues the innovation once championed by his aunt, Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, in the ’80s and ’90s.\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, A.B. Quintanilla III, Principe Q has dedicated himself to producing and shaping fresh sounds for rising artists. Since adopting his moniker in 2012, he has performed as a DJ across the country, contributing to Houston’s flourishing cumbia scene as part of the Bombon collective. His work with Royal Highness led to performances at major festivals in Mexico, including Ceremonia and EDC Mexico. In recent years, he has graced the lineups of renowned events like Bonnaroo, Boiler Room, and EDC Orlando, cementing his place as a key force in the evolution of modern cumbia.",

The band have achieved major streaming and editorial success with singles including “Scorching Heat”, “Golden Boy\", \"Moving\" and \"Daddy\", while their breakout track “Tractor Parts” has recently surpassed one million streams. The band has even caught the attention of music tastemaker Derrick Gee who named Radium Dolls his “favourite band of the moment”. With their debut American tour ahead and SXSW appearances, Radium Dolls are poised to introduce North America to the next era of Australian rock.",

Her music folds together voice, field recording, and emotion into layered compositions that feel intimate and expansive. She has become a quietly singular presence in the Icelandic music landscape, performing with artists like Nanna (Of Monsters and Men), Axel Flóvent, and Kaktus Einarsson. Her debut album - a place to be - was released on Ólafur Arnalds’ OPIA Community in October 2025 and garnered widespread acclaim from top Icelandic and global media alikel, with The Line of Best Fit calling her “Iceland’s next breakout star” and writeups in Billboard, Exclaim!, SPIN, London Standard and more. She dominated the Iceland Airwaves festival in November 2025, with the festival awarding her the prestigious “PLUS Award”, granted to one artist each year that is ready to take over the world.\n\na place to be is part diary, part landscape. Birds, clocks, breath, soft synths, the creak of a floorboard, nothing is too small to become part of the composition. RAKEL’s work invites you into a space where thought becomes sound, memory becomes movement, and music becomes a place to be, for now.",

    "description": "Chicago-born and Atlanta-raised, Raq Baby is carving out his own lane in hip-hop with an unapologetic sound that blends raw street emotion with melodic vulnerability. His music captures the highs and lows of his come-up — gritty, honest, and charged with energy that connects instantly with the youth of his generation. Raq continues to captivate his audience with is newest project I Never Gave AF, a bold statement of self-determination that earned him a placement on local playlists and music blogs across the South. His sound fuses the unfiltered storytelling of classic trap with drill rap — creating music that hits hard both in the club and through headphones. On stage, Raq’s presence is magnetic. He’s performed alongside artists like SahBabii, YTB Fatt, Hunxho, and Vonoff1700, bringing an unmatched energy that’s helped him sell out his first headline show at Atlanta’s Aisle 5 and secure bookings at Rolling Loud. Beyond the music, Raq Baby stands as a voice for authenticity — a young artist who’s seen struggle, growth, and triumph, and channels all of it into his art. Raq Baby is more than an artist — he’s a movement in the making.",

    "description": "The Red Eye Gamblers are a psychedelic southern rock band with a uniquely Austin, Texas sound. They bridge elements of rock, bluegrass, and jammy psychedelia to create a new experience with every show.\n\nThey have a deep repertoire, and in over two years of live shows, they have never played the same set list twice. They will often venture outside of their normal 5-piece lineup featuring a saxophone, djembe, and harmonica to create an unforgettable live experience.\n\nThey released their debut single \"Let You Down Easy\" in October 2024. A fan favorite from live shows, \"Let You Down Easy\" is a fast-paced song about simply saying goodbye. In September 2025, they followed it up with their next single \"Whiskey Memories.\" \"Whiskey Memories\" is a powerful ballad about reminiscing on the past and learning to move on from the troubles it may have caused. The song features introspective lyrics, instrumental breakdowns, and showcases even more of what The Red Eye Gamblers have to offer.\n\nFrom starting with backyard shows in east Austin, all the way to the Continental Club and the incredible stages at SXSW 2025, The Red Eye Gamblers are one of THE bands to watch for SXSW 2026 & beyond",

Writing and producing everything himself — from raw guitar riffs to hard-hitting beats — he fuses serrated modern rap with the weight of late-’90s/’00s metal. The result is a dark, cinematic crossover that speaks fluent mosh pit and playlist alike.\n\nHis 2024 album Tales Of A Necromancer solidified a singular vision, while viral tracks like “Rave In The Grave,” “Meth Phonk,” and “Drugs = Magic” have racked up tens of millions of streams, pushing him past one million monthly Spotify listeners worldwide.\n\nOnstage, REDZED is relentless — sweat-drenched, high-impact, and impossible to ignore. After sold-out headline shows, international tours, and major European festival slots, he arrives ready to turn SXSW into a collision of rap kids and metal die-hards.",

    "description": "Inspired by her culturally rich & diverse upbringing, between her Pakistani-Muslim heritage to her formative days in Chicago, REHMA's sonic worlds are eclectic & vibrant. The singer-songwriter artfully weaves her powerful vocals with poetic lyricism, floating between pop, dance, and R&B, to create a singular soundscape & aesthetic that she coins as \"desi-futurism\"\nOff the back a buzzing 2024, with a massive feature on Coke Studio (100M+ views across platforms), the cover of EQUAL Pakistan & a top slot on the Best Of Fresh Finds Year-End List), & earned co-signs from Savan Kotecha, Natasha Noorani, Zulfi, Sid Sriram & more. She's cemented herself as a promising creative force, not only in the rising South Asian diaspora, but across global pop music. Her forthcoming project, ANOMALY, is a refreshing take on modern pop & a timely, urgent coming of age story from the Pakistani-Muslim multi-hyphenate as she navigates her identity, religion, sexuality, and femininity.",

Hailing from Texas and now rooted in the Chicago music scene, she’s made a name for herself with her “small, but mighty” voice and songs that cut to the bone. Downes has shared the stage with artists like Maggie Rose, Kaitlin Butts, and Jaime Wyatt, and has been featured in Rollingstone.\n\nWith a background in both the Americana and indie circuits, Reilly delivers raw, emotionally charged performances with her band, The Acid Cowboys. Her songs, like sad polaroids of love and loss, explore themes of queer identity, grief, and survival.\n\nShe is currently in the process of recording her sophomore album with executive production by Jaime Wyatt who has worked alongside Butch Walker, Shooter Jennings, The Black Pumas, and more.",

    "description": "From Charlotte, NC, Vincent has already built an uncommon résumé—releasing music with 9th Wonder, touring alongside Rapsody, Pusha T & Bas and earning a reputation for wisdom and restraint well beyond his years. His growing catalog balances incisive commentary, emotional maturity, and allusion-heavy wordplay, guided by a deep respect for where hip-hop has been and a clear vision for where it can go next.\nThat vision comes fully into focus on Welcome Home, his latest album and a defining statement in his career. Produced entirely by 9th Wonder, the project is a reflective homecoming—both literal and spiritual—chronicling 25 y/o Vincent’s return to North Carolina after time spent chasing ambition elsewhere. Across warm, soulful, modernized boom-bap, he explores belonging, faith, failure, and growth, positioning “home” not just as a place, but as a state of mind.\nNow signed to Roc Nation and firmly aligned with the Jamla lineage, Reuben Vincent isn’t chasing accolades—he’s building something more enduring. With Welcome Home, he stands as both a student of the culture and a leader within it, pushing North Carolina rap forward while honoring the foundation that shaped him",

    "description": "The Reverent Few emerged from Chicago’s blues scene and have called Austin home for over a decade. They are a band bound by shared history, raw honesty, and a lived-in belief in the power of music to connect and heal. With voices that carry like old hymns and instrumentation that cuts with both grit and grace, their songs aren’t just played, they’re inhabited. There’s gospel in the bones, blues in the breath, and rock and roll in the resolve. Their debut album, Ain’t No Place to Be (2020), was recorded in Dripping Springs and released through Bearpath Records. It's an eight-track collection steeped in soul both sonically and spiritually featuring contributions from Anthony Farrell of The Greyhounds. Critics praised its emotional weight and its blend of warmth, pain, and resilience. Their latest single, The World Will Be Wood to You, recorded live to tape at DogStar Studios, is a raw, analog meditation on loss and grace. Written during quiet reckonings and bedside goodbyes, it holds ache and light in equal measure. It's an offering, a gesture toward gentleness in a fractured world. The Reverent Few remind us that tenderness still matters, that community still holds.",

Writing primarily on her own, she creates music that feels grounded and familiar - and yet wholly her own. Influenced by both the country classics and also Americana with a modern edge, her songs lean on acoustic guitars, simple arrangements, and lyrics that leave room to breathe. Whether written quietly at home or brought to life in the studio with producers Caleb Nelson (Mt. Joy) and Patrick Lyons (Colter Wall, Luke Grimes, Noeline Hoffman), Saige’s music shows a deep respect for timeless storytelling and feels imminent for a breakthrough in the year ahead.",

    "description": "Saint Avangeline is an Atlanta-based independent artist, merging ethereal sounds with raw, unfiltered vocals, crafting a striking contrast that mirrors the depths of human emotion. Deeply rooted in her journey with mental health, domestic abuse, & growing up queer, her songs offer an honest exploration of inner turmoil, rage, hope, & resilience.\nGrowing up with her head in a sketchbook & performing in various orchestras, and jazz bands, combined with her unique sound-to-color synesthesia known as Chromesthesia, Avangeline focuses on writing and creating from a color palette. Music is like painting, every sound is a different texture, color, and form. She also often listens to music in languages she doesn't understand, are made up or distorted, or that contain no words at all. She found that she could focus more deeply on the emotion embedded within the sound and she would often memorize entire orchestral scores and video game soundtracks as a child.\nFocusing on painting an image not only through words but through the very fiber of sound, her music strives to transcend the barriers of language and strike hearts in the way hers was.",

Having quickly risen to Internet fame from public support from SZA and Jazmine Sullivan to Justin Bieber, Timbaland and Elton John, he’s one of the latest artists to watch. Citing Amy Winehouse and Frank Ocean as two key musical influences, Saint has been covered by Rolling Stone, British Vogue, Wonderland, etc. and was named Apple Music's global Up Next artist. He made his late night TV debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! after his viral COLORS performance of “ego talkin,” which sparked the viral #egotalkinchallenge on TikTok. His 7-track EP lost a friend was released in 2023 and has amassed over 200M cumulative streams, continuing to grow. He returned in fall 2025 with his single \"ghosted,\" and recently released his latest single \"bad,\" produced by Grammy-winning producer duo NovaWav (Beyoncé, JAY-Z, Jazmine Sullivan, etc.).

    "description": "To a growing group of those in the know, the name SAMWOY signals epic, genre-warping\nmusic that cuts through the Canadian landscape with rare force. Led by Montreal-based auteur\nSam Woywitka, the project has evolved into a powerhouse collective of the city’s most\nadventurous musicians. SAMWOY’s tracks veer from ambient serenity and lush orchestration to explosive synths and\ndistorted rhythms, all anchored by Woywitka’s obsession with emotional extremes. His\nsophomore album Even Sad Boys Like To Have Fun is out now and has become a\nbreakthrough release, charting on Earshot for 48 consecutive weeks while earning national\nand international attention. Live, SAMWOY is a visceral experience volatile, beautiful, unpredictable. The project has\ndelivered acclaimed showcases at POP Montreal and M for Montreal, as well as a standout\nperformance at SXSW.\nRooted in themes of chaos, catharsis, and redemption shaped in part by Woywitka’s near-fatal\ncar accident in his Vancouver Island hometown. SAMWOY’s music thrives on contrast:\npost-punk grit against electronic gloss, euphoria against collapse. It’s a world where nothing is\noff limits and beauty is always carved from the wreckage.",

    "description": "Irish/Brighton-based artist Sarah Crean is an indie-pop singer-songwriter whose music combines emotional clarity with layered, melodic arrangements. Her 2023 EP Death by Laundry featured the breakout single “2:00am,” now streamed over 7.5 million times on Spotify, and earned support from BBC Introducing, BBC Radio 1, The Line of Best Fit, Clash, Nialler9, and Spotify editorial playlists. The first single from her upcoming album, “22 Angel,” has already reached 80,000 streams and was featured on New Pop UK.\n\nSarah has toured the UK supporting acts including Florence Road, U.S. Girls, and Bombay Bicycle Club, with highlights such as a performance at the O2 Forum London alongside CMAT. Now independent and on the verge of her debut album - created entirely by women and inspired by the myth of Calypso - Crean explores heartbreak, home, and everything in between. With the album due mid-2026, she is emerging as one of alt-indie pop’s most compelling new voices.",

    "description": "Sasha Wrist is a bilingual singer-songwriter and vocal artist from Venezuela, now based in Los\nAngeles. Her genre-bending sound fuses the grit of hip-hop, the pulse of electronic music, the\nsensuality of R&B, and the emotional depth of Latin pop.\n\nHer voice first gained traction in the global music scene through the viral success of her Splice\nvocal packs, which have been downloaded and sampled by producers worldwide, incorporating Sasha’s vocals into standout tracks like “Famax” and “Perreo”.\n\nIn late 2024, Sasha released her debut album, LA CHAMA. More than just a debut, the album serves as a love letter to her Venezuelan roots. Tracks like “SUR,” “CORO,” “KRTELUO,” and “LLANEROS” explore her upbringing, resilience, and self-discovery.\n\nBeginning in early 2025, Sasha made a sharp artistic pivot with the release of The Wrist\nWave, a melodic house EP with tracks like “Ya Te Borre,” and “IGOT2.\" She also collaborated with some of the world’s biggest phonk artists, Ariis, YB Wasg'ood, and Nakama, on their track “LUNA LA.”\n\nSasha Wrist's next project, titled \"404:NJD\" will release in February 15 and will bring her back to rap roots.",

    "description": "Sassy 009 is the shape-shifting project from Oslo-based producer, songwriter and vocalist Sunniva Lindgård. After finding early acclaim as a trio with 2017’s Do You Mind EP, Sassy 009 rebooted as a solo vehicle in 2019, later evolving into 2021’s sultry, bass-driven Heart Ego mixtape. But for Lindgård, her album Dreamer+ is her true debut: a concept-driven album pieced together from nearly four years of studio effort, and an ambitious attempt to take complete control of her artistry. Steered by freshly distorted vocals and elements of grunge, shoegaze, ‘90s beatronica and gauzy hyperpop, the album is a record of self-discovery and self-effacement at once, studded with guest contributions from Blood Orange, BEA1991 and Yunè Pinku.\n\nSince the release of Dreamer+ in January, Sassy 009 has sold out her UK and EU tour dates, toured as main support for Blood Orange, had press support from Pitchfork, Stereogum, The FADER, CLASH, CRACK, DAZED and more.. she's collaborated with US rap superstar Don Toliver by adding vocals to his track 'Pleasures Mine' from his Billboard no.1 album 'Octane'. 2026 has a lot more in store for Sassy 009.",

He creates music inspired by anime and gaming but written for the soundtrack of life.\n\nThe closest thing you'll ever meet to a real-life anime character, Shao travelled solo to China to train with monks in Shaolin Kung Fu, he taught himself Japanese and now raps skilfully in two languages.\n\nA fiercely independent artist, Shao creates powerful, genre-blending music built on infectious hooks and razor-sharp lyricism. He was selected as the official England representative for the UK’s National Day at Expo 2025 in Osaka, and invited to perform for the Japanese ambassador at the Embassy of Japan in London.\n\nShao Dow’s music has featured in 'Fortnite' and has been used by games 'God of War' and 'Borderlands 4' as well as Amazon Prime Video for the Arsenal documentary. He also writes the music for the popular One Jump Man vs Shaggy Ball Z animated series.\n\nWhen it comes to performing, Shao delivers an unforgettable stage show — mixing high-energy music and Kung Fu for an experience unlike any other, continuing to prove that independence, musical excellence, and Anime Protagonist Energy can go hand in hand.",

    "description": "Aaron Perrino refuses to be beat. The Boston music scene veteran, who helms The Sheila Divine, has spent decades confounding expectations with songs that deftly weave power-punching political criticism amongst mundane daily frustrations. Songs that expose purest grief alongside deepest love.\n\nThe Sheila Divine’s upcoming sixth album, The Middle Ages (out DATE on Trash Casual), is a deeply human document of everyday life. Across ten new tracks Perrino bares his soul and searches his heart in songs that navigate the wide gamut of lived experience: from the wrenching loss of his mother, through parental anxieties for his own children’s wellbeing, to the strains of congested city life, fractured relationships, and rage at what his nation has turned into.",

    "description": "Short Life is a Mexican-born, LA based artist redefining what Latin alternative pop sounds like.\nRaised between cultures, languages, and expectations, he grew up carrying two worlds at once, Monterrey roots and American influence. That duality became his sound. Singing in Spanish, building an alternative space with indie vulnerability, and pop melody, He gained major recognition last year SXSW after winning a new emerging talent competition hosted by legendary producer Timbaland. But instead of chasing trends, he chose to build a universe.\nThat universe is now evolving. With his latest project, La Vida Corta, Short Life steps fully into an alternative Latin pop direction — darker, more poetic, more intentional. The title carries a double meaning: life is short, and life cuts. Across seven songs, he explores heartbreak, rejection, passion, and healing — not as tragedy, but as transformation. The project leans into atmosphere, storytelling, and emotional tension, pushing beyond genre and into feeling.\nHis music speaks directly to “Los Séptimos,” his growing fan base a community that connects to his message of living fully, loving deeply, and honoring the scars that shape us.",

He calls his music “regular people rap,” but what distinguishes him is scale of vision. Each release arrives as a fully realized world, complete with its own aesthetic system, narrative arc, live direction, and sold-out limited merch.\n\nHe doesn’t drop projects. He builds worlds.\n\nConcepts unfold through alter egos, staged moments, and immersive performances that feel cinematic without losing emotional precision. Beyond his own catalog, his annual Sir Eddie C & Friends show has grown into a packed, independently produced homecoming concert, proof that his audience doesn’t just listen. They participate, invest, and return.\n\nWith a sharp pen, controlled visual language, and commanding stage presence, Sir Eddie C operates as a full-package artist and multidisciplinary brand architect. He’s not waiting to be discovered. He’s constructing something too intentional to ignore.",

The vibrant music is the perfect trojan horse for wildly irreverent lyrics featuring such characters as The Rich Pervert in the self driving car or The Repeater who corners you on a bar patio and subjects you to a never ending loop of the same three sentences. Slomo is kicking off 2026 with a string of single releases on Spaceflight Records, starting with \"Fresh Bread\" - a hypnotically catch tune for folks who love paranoia and malaise with their pop.",

    "description": "Social Order is a Los Angeles and Las Vegas–based trio blending melodic pop, post punk, and darkwave into a sound that feels both cinematic and intimate. Formed during the isolation of 2020, the band features Mason Musso and Anthony Improgo of Metro Station alongside Andrew Ward of Nuwave Fighters. Their music explores the tension between nostalgia and reinvention, light and shadow, intimacy and distance.\n\nThey gained early attention with their debut EP How To Lie, followed by singles Worst Way, All My Life, Boys, and the EP Strangers, earning placement on Spotify’s Darkwave playlist and praise from Alternative Press and Post-Punk.com. Entirely self-produced and self-directed, Social Order maintain a strong DIY ethos. The band made their major festival debut at Cruel World and completed a North American tour with French Police in November, continuing to expand their shadowy, emotionally charged world.",

    "description": "Sofish is one of the most compelling voices in Mexico’s alternative scene. A singer, songwriter, and Berklee College of Music & Latin Grammy Cultural Foundation scholar, she crafts a sophisticated blend of French House, R&B, and Alt-Pop. Her global appeal was cemented when her single \"Me Caigo\" went viral across Europe and LatAm, leading Remezcla to call her \"iconic… fresh and elegant… diva alert.\"\n\nFollowing standout performances at Tecate Emblema and Lunario at Auditorio Nacional, Sofish’s momentum reached new heights in 2025 as the cover of Spotify’s \"Novedades Viernes\" and opening for pop icon Belinda at Fiestas de Octubre. With over 5 million streams, her sound has dominated flagship playlists like Fresh Finds Global and Mixto.\n\nCurrently, Sofish is preparing the release of her debut album, La Femme Illustrée (May 2026), a cinematic project that explores high-end visual artistry and visceral storytelling. Arriving at SXSW 2026 as a genre-bending force, Sofish is not just a rising star—she is the architect of a new, elegant era in Latin alternative music.",

Their debut single “Better” was called “riveting and spellbinding” by American Songwriter, setting the tone for a body of work that favors vulnerability, restraint, and depth.\n\nA longtime presence in the Austin music community, Somebody Someone has been featured by NPR’s Tiny Desk, selected for the Tiny Desk Contest On The Road Tour, appeared on the popular Telepathy Tapes podcast, and performed at Adam Duritz of Counting Crows’ Underwater Sunshine Festival in NYC. Their work invites deep listening and connection—music that lingers, revealing more with each pass.",

    "description": "someshiit is a Taiwanese hip-hop artist known for his unique blend of bedroom rap and live band arrangements. Drawing influence from UK, Japanese, and Korean hip-hop, he emerged in 2019 with the breakout single “Those Who Told Me to Quit Smoking Are All Dead” (5M+ views on YouTube), the track’s poetic and raw storytelling quickly resonated with a new generation of listeners. His debut album ‘A FOOL’ pushed even further, fusing gritty lyricism with lush, genre-blurring production alongside collaborators like Samjoo (deca joins), Sam Yang, and Pei-Yu Hung, earning him Best New Artist at the Golden Melody Awards, Taiwan’s most prestigious music honor.\nFrom TV screens “The Rappers 2” to major Taiwanese festival stages like Megaport, Vagabond, and FireBall Fest, he weaves lush live-band arrangements as the backbone of his sound, layered with razor-sharp, prose-like lyricism that cuts straight to the core. His self-produced shows consistently sell out, including his first overseas performance in Hong Kong, proving that his music’s emotional gravity transcends borders. Internationally, he has worked alongside acclaimed Japanese rapper maco marets and South Korean psychedelic band CHS, garnering attention from various media outlets and hip-hop labels.\n\nWith a reimagined EP set to drop in 2025 marking six years since his breakout hit, someshiit isn’t just evolving, he’s shaping a new creative language for Mandarin rap, redefining its boundaries one verse at a time.",

    "description": "Sonido Cachimbo is a cumbia project born in Ciudad Juárez, México, and rooted in the lived experience of the Juárez–El Paso border region. Formed in the early 2010s amid a context marked by violence, migration, and social fragmentation, the project transforms those realities into an energetic and celebratory sound grounded in popular dance traditions.\n\nBlending cumbia with elements of rock, punk, and other hybrid influences, Sonido Cachimbo creates music that invites collective joy while carrying the memory and resilience of border communities. Their live performances are known for their high energy, festive atmosphere, and strong connection with diverse audiences on both sides of the border.\n\nThe project has released two full-length albums, Tropicumbia Fronteriza (2014) and Fiesta Popular (2017), the latter co-produced by Rodrigo Rojas of the Chilean band Juanafe, and has collaborated with artists such as Clemente Castillo (Jumbo), Edna Nao, and Paulina del Campo. In 2024, Sonido Cachimbo released “Monitor,” a reinterpretation of the song by Volován. The group is currently working on a new EP of original material planned for vinyl release.",

Taiwanese lyrics are an essential base of their songwriting as well as a hallmark of Sorry Youth, and the song arrangements capture a strong sense of live performance. They have established one of the unique features of the Taiwanese-rock sound nowadays with the essence of their music that is deeply influenced by bands from the 80s and 90s, such as The Cure, Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo, Mogwai, The National, and Wilco, etc.\n\nAs one of the leading acts in Taiwan’s independent music scene, Sorry Youth has sold out numerous headline shows and performed at major festivals including Summer Sonic (JP), Megaport Festival (TW), Shima Fes SETOUCHI (JP), Mori Michi Ichiba (JP), and SXSW (US). Their international tours have taken them across Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Hong Kong, among others.\n\nAs they enter their 20th year, Sorry Youth continues to expand their global reach, with upcoming performances at CLANG Music Festival 2025 (SG), Busan International Rock Festival (KR), and a new Japan tour in 2025.",

    "description": "SouthSide Hippie is an Austin-based alternative Hip-Hop and R&B artist/producer carving space between grit and introspection. Blending soul-heavy melodies with raw Southern texture, his sound lives where vulnerability meets street wisdom. It’s music for late-night drives, scarred hearts, and people building themselves from the inside out.\n\nRooted in honesty and emotional range, SouthSide Hippie’s work pulls from the lived experiences of himself and others around him rather than trends. His songs explore survival, self-belief, love, and legacy, often wrapped in minimalist production and hypnotic grooves that let the message breathe.\n\nWith a growing reputation in Austin’s underground and a sound that feels both grounded and forward-leaning, SouthSide Hippie represents a new wave of artists redefining what Southern alternative music can be. His SXSW performance marks another step in a journey driven by authenticity, independence, and creative freedom.",

Their current mission: to reinvent what it means to be a Hip-Hop artist in the capital city of Texas. They are returning to SXSW for the third consecutive year, continuing to help elevate the local Hip-Hop scene into a nationally recognized hub for the art form. Comparable to Wu-Tang Clan, Brockhampton, Flatbush Zombies, ETC. Consisting of members from all around the country and spanning multiple generations, their sound is a collage of the different Hip-Hop practices, melded together by the diverse backgrounds of every member. So it doesn’t matter what god you believe in or what media you consume, as long as, when we say “Space,” you say… “Goonz”",

Spacestation has in the past couple of years gained a reputation as the country’s most exciting new rock group and its most proliferate live band.\n\nLike Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine before them, Spacestation aspire to redefine what noise can be within the context of pop music.\n\nTheir music combines inventive use of alternate tunings, guitar strumming and feedback, with the intensity of shoegaze, catchy Krautrock rhythms and the attitude of 60s psychedelia, to create a new, jogging, sonic landscape that makes you waste away insightful nights dancing with strangers.",

    "description": "Atlanta-based artist Spencer Thomas returns with Cynical Vision, his third and most incisive album yet, out March 20, 2026. Wry and sardonic, the record balances humor and existential dread, blending retro synths, vintage drum machines, and fuzzed-out guitars into an intoxicating mix of analog and electronic sounds. Nods to Randy Newman, Lou Reed, Warren Zevon, and Tom Petty shine through as Thomas holds a mirror to modern life, delivering a whip-smart meditation on the absurdity and beauty of living and loving in the 21st century.\n\n“In a lot of ways, it felt impossible for me to not write about this stuff,” Thomas says. “I leaned into what felt interesting and current and funny, and tried to make something visceral and honest.”\n\nAfter releasing his 2019 solo debut Hangin’ Tough, he moved to Athens, GA in 2020 and joined indie rock band Futurebirds as their keyboardist. “It was a fantastic opportunity,” he explains, “but it kept me away from home and from my own music.” His 2024 sophomore album The Joke of Life earned rave reviews, and in 2025 he stepped away from Futurebirds to devote himself fully to creating Cynical Vision.",

    "description": "Spike F*ck is a rare figure in contemporary music: direct, disarming, and impossible to pin down. Emerging from Melbourne’s underground in the late 2010s with The Smackwave EP, Spike fused bleak synth-pop, post-punk melodrama, and brutally honest songwriting into something both vulnerable and confrontational. Armed with only a backing track and a microphone, early live shows saw Spike sing candidly about addiction, gender, dysfunctional love, and collapse: a kind of wounded sincerity that quickly drew a cult following. Just as things seemed to be breaking open, Spike disappeared, retreating from public life amid a personal reckoning.\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus -- during which time rumours swirled about death, institutions, or becoming a monk -- Spike returned sober, clear-eyed, and transformed. The music that followed is bigger, wilder, and more alive. Performed with a rotating full band, the new material draws from ‘70s glam, spiritual soul, and damaged rock and roll, but always filtered through Spike’s unmistakable voice: bruised, intense, poetic.\n\nThese are songs about recovery, identity, survival, and letting go not sanitised, not triumphant, but real. Where the early work stared into the void, the new work steps forward with purpose. It’s not a reinvention. It’s an evolution, one born from chaos, now grounded in clarity.",

Stripped down and loud, the band thrives on a high-energy live show that feels just barely contained—fast, sweaty, and direct, with nothing wasted.\nBuilt on constant movement, Spoon Benders have spent years touring relentlessly, honing their sound on stages across the country and earning a reputation as a band that hits hard and never phones it in. Their music channels punk’s urgency and grit, powered by tight chemistry and an aggressive edge that only a three-piece can deliver.\nNow, Spoon Benders are preparing to release their highly anticipated third album, capturing the intensity of the road and the confidence of a band fully in its stride. With new songs on the way and the volume turned up, Spoon Benders continue to prove that three people are more than enough to make some serious noise.",

    "description": "Stalefish is a 6 piece rock/pop band based in Austin, TX. Coming off of their 2025 EP, 'New Pop Experiments Vol. 1', the band is currently finishing their 3rd LP, 'Bueno', recorded in the first two weeks of 2026.\n\nContrary to their bedroom studio/DI upbringing, this is their first attempt at recording the basic tracks live, minimizing overdubs. It is an effort to inject the raw energy of their live performances into their recordings.\n\nStalefish has 3 lead singers/songwriters: Dalton Hausman, Jake Magee, and producer turned bandmate Sam Franklin. The resulting songs are about love and heartbreak, infatuation, loneliness, and skepticism of the current music landscape. Inspired by artists like Ween, Wilco, and Teenage Fanclub, the band offers a collection of their patented ‘90s/’00s style rock, complete with synthesizer, saxophone, glockenspiel, guitar solos, and funky, odd time signatures.\n\nDubbing themselves the “hardest working slacker rock band”, Stalefish has always operated under a true DIY ethos. With their forthcoming LP, the band looks to take that mindset and apply it to the national/international stage.\n\nRIYL: Ween, Wilco, Spoon, Teenage Fanclub, Dinosaur Jr.",

Haunting melodies and brooding soundscapes channel the spirit of goth-driven acts from that era, offering a sonic journey steeped in existential reflection and melancholic beauty. A true embodiment of modern dark romanticism, Stare Away continues to captivate audiences seeking meaning in the shadows.",

    "description": "Still Blank’s sound is a unique blend of shoegaze haze, folk intimacy, and emotionally raw ambient alt-rock grit. With lyrics steeped in people-watching, dreams, nature, and existential observation, their songwriting draws from both introspection and their surroundings. Ben and Jordy met by chance in Liverpool 2 years ago sparking a lightning-in-a-bottle creative partnership. What started as casual jam sessions in a basement quickly evolved, with sessions ranging from stripped-back recordings on a broken classical guitar to studio lock-ins fuelled by long walks through rural Wales and a shared commitment to imperfection. In May 2025 they performed their first show as a band at Permanent Records Roadhouse. Debut single \"What About Jane\" is a grungy, folk-inflected reflection on identity, societal perception, and the expectations we’re forced to confront to uncover who we really are.",

    "description": "Suck Brick Kid is a hook-heavy pop-punk band built on big riffs, bigger choruses, and just enough self-awareness to keep it dangerous. For over a decade, they’ve balanced earnest, heart-on-sleeve energy with sharp, tongue-in-cheek lyricism—turning existential spirals and dive-bar observations into shout-along anthems. Their releases are tight, punchy, and conceptually driven, walking the line between chaos and craft. Known for sweaty, cathartic live shows that feel equal parts therapy session and house party, the band thrives in rooms where volume and vulnerability coexist. Suck Brick Kid isn’t trying to reinvent punk—just to play it loud, honest, and impossible to ignore.",

As they prepare to promote their debut album, due in April, the band is evolving its sound — keeping their regional rhythms and DIY spirit while weaving in samples, drum machines, and experimental, dance-driven styles. This collision of influences does true justice to the yonke in their name: raw, eclectic, and born from the beautiful chaos of the border. Recent milestones include a tour supporting Tropa Mágica and a standout performance at SXSW, solidifying their expanding live footprint.",

    "description": "With a Spellemann (norwegian Grammy) nomination for their debut album in hand, Sūn Byrd is ready to kick off the new campaign for the upcoming album In Paradiso, heavily inspired by American and British soul from the 60s and 70s.\n\nWith a horn section that never rests, basslines that drive the songs forward, neatly ironed pants, and undeniable coolness, Sūn Byrd could just as easily be born in New Orleans as in Oslo. But it's in Norway that they've first made a name for themselves. They released their Spellemann-nominated debut album in 2024 and have already played over 250 concerts together. You can just try to imagine how tight Sūn Byrd sounds live, and then add a little more. Now, they're about to release In Paradiso, their first album on Jansen Records.\n\nOn In Paradiso, you'll be served soulful tracks that follow in the footsteps of artists like Leon Bridges, Thee Sacred Souls, and Sharon Jones and The Dap-Kings. Johan Helland's vocals are perhaps the first thing that stands out, with its distinctive tone, range, and vulnerability, but it’s when the whole band comes in that you’re truly dazzled. The keys, horns, guitar, and bass all find their place, seamlessly shifting between being a musical locomotive and charming you into submission with beautiful ballads.\n\nSūn Byrd’s music is universal and timeless, and there’s really nothing that sounds like this on the Norwegian music scene today. It’s perfect for large festival stages, would make a great soundtrack for countless films, or simply while you hang out after closing time at a smoke-filled off-license bar in the southern U.S.\n\nPosting Spotify link here, since it did not work below: https://open.spotify.com/artist/32PUtLgz3SzD5Ihjdxoa6r?si=-g3wUV8ARxy3Htw3bXNW0Q",

    "description": "Born and raised in San Diego’s surf-rock scene, Sun Room went from getting their house shows shut down for playing too loudly to selling out venues across a dozen countries. Formed in 2021, the band gained viral attention after two songs featured on Netflix’s Outer Banks. Expanding beyond their hometown, they sold out U.S. shows, supported Louis Tomlinson, toured Europe with Inhaler, and headlined their first North American tour in fall 2022, selling over 15,000 tickets. In spring 2023, Sun Room toured North America with Inhaler before returning to SoCal to finish At Least I Tried, which earned widespread acclaim.\n\nIn summer 2025, Sun Room released their latest EP, Ritual of Chaos, before supporting Flipturn and embarking on a 20+ date headline tour. The project showcases the band’s love of blues-rock, shoegaze and post-punk garage influences absorbed from playing worldwide. Their live show channels the energy of their early San Diego house shows - bigger and more electrifying with every performance.\n\nSun Room continues to push their sound, explore new cities, and draw inspiration from their experiences. Their highly anticipated debut album is set for release in early 2026.",

They’ve made a box big enough to hold post-punk, grunge, college rock, shoegaze, and post-hardcore, and Sunforger is still firmly outside it. Their effortless uniqueness is built on rhythmic and percussive guitars, infinitely repeatable cadences, and emotive hypnagogia. The name Sunforger is spoken with reverence in DIY circles across North America, disseminated over half a decade of Bandcamp deep-diving, touring, festivals, a self-titled album, and a 7-minute EP. Sunforger’s eagerly awaited second album, entitled Weight, arrives May 2026 via the labels Cooked Raw and Julia’s War.",

Born in Los Angeles and raised in Missouri City, Texas, she started taking music seriously in high school not because it was trendy, but because it felt natural. She’s had early exposure to the industry through development experiences connected to Mathew Knowles, but her real growth came from figuring it out herself. Trial, error, independent releases, long studio nights all of it shaped her sound. Her music is bold, fun, and direct. It’s about feeling good, looking good, standing on business, and not shrinking for anyone. She doesn’t try to be overly lyrical for validation or overly commercial for approval she makes records that match her personality: confident, feminine, and unapologetic. With a growing streaming presence and consistent visuals, Sunnitharapper is building her brand the organic way by showing up, staying consistent, and connecting with people who genuinely rock with her energy. She’s not chasing trends. She’s building longevity.",

    "description": "Sunshine Spazz is a garage rock power trio with hints of punk and blues from Ocean County, New Jersey. Ryan Rutter (guitar/vocals) and Michael Rutter (bass) are brothers by blood, and that can be felt in the music as they battle for their tones to be heard, whether the fuzzy bass prevails or the reverberating, delayed guitar grabs your sonic sensations. Jamie Lawler (drums) is the glue of the band, as well as the moderator that keeps The Rutter Brothers from turning the musical space into a combat ring.\nSunshine Spazz's self-titled debut album released in November of 2023, and allowed them to complete two interstate runs, as well as the opportunity to play Asbury Park's Sea.Hear.Now Festival in September of 2024 alongside acts like Bruce Springsteen, Action Bronson, The Gaslight Anthem, Illiterate Light, and many more. With singles to be released in fall and winter of 2025, and an album release in January 2026, the three boys bonded by rock will be hitting the road much more. Their new album packs a punch that is a beautiful release in dealing with grief. After losing a very dear friend, Sunshine Spazz has transformed this project into a creative coping mechanism and a tribute that reflects the depth of their bond that once was. It goes to show that what seemingly ends, actually continues energetically.",

Flanagan began circulating studios filled with aspiring millennial producers in his teens, informed by an orchestral background fueled by public school music programs in which he played both upright bass and violin. It was then that he taught himself to use DAWs and the rules of “heavily-produced” pop music.\n\nFlanagan found success during the pandemic under his first name, ‘KALI’. His initial releases garnered the appearance of a budding career as an indie-pop star, with millions of streams and collaborations with seasoned high-profile producers and industry teams. Despite the upward mobility, Flanagan’s growing interpersonal dysphoria was easily a metaphor for his dissatisfaction with his artistic output and community as he reached adulthood. Growing up in Los Angeles was contingent on this ever-present new wave of pop music oblivion; “hits” made in 5-hour sessions with strangers, a social life suffocated by others’ aspirations for fame, and an absent audience for live music that pushed past the prescriptions of recorded music. Following his physical transition (to become male), his three-word synth pop hooks were swapped out for stanzas describing dissociation and gender envy, soundtracked by a now-signature, deeply tuned acoustic guitar.\n\nFlanagan’s pared-down playing style and vocal have drawn comparisons to songwriters as Kurt Cobain, Leonard Cohen and Nick Drake. He has held monthly residencies at the now-defunct Los Angeles staple Genghis Cohen, (which drew the attendance of Julian Casablancas) and New York’s Pete’s Candy Store. Superfan has since played shows with the likes of Jordan Patterson (with whom both Flanagan and Almassi are frequent contributors), Quiet Light, untitled (halo), Autobahn, Horsegirl, Userband, as well as in the UK & Europe alongside acts such as Tiberius B and Samba Jean Baptiste. He is booked for shows with Kelora, Knifeplay, Dan English, and Kath Bloom in the fall. Flanagan is a member of the rising NYC emo band, Holidays in United States, who is in the process of recording a full-length project. Additional contributions as a multi-instrumentalist will be found on Jordan Patterson’s upcoming debut, “The Hermit”. Kali is currently a student at Hunter College studying Anthropology and writing as a freelancer for the artist-favorite Creative Independent.",

    "description": "SUUVI is a Cuban-Chinese composer, producer, and multidisciplinary artist whose roots in electronic cello-driven performance inform a bold, genre-fluid sonic vision. After 15+ years appearing internationally as a classical soloist in venues such as Carnegie Hall, La Fondation Louis Vuitton, and the Berlin Philharmonie - and touring as the solo cellist in Hans Zimmer’s live show - she expanded beyond the stage, blending cello, electronics, and storytelling to craft immersive works that reflect her multicultural background and social-impact mission. She has composed and produced original music for theater, dance, and film/TV, working across genres from contemporary classical to electronic, hip-hop, and pop, with artists like D-Smoke, Teyana Taylor, FAVE and many more - earning recognition for her boundary-pushing artistry and emotional depth.\n\nHer debut album, Dark Therapy, pushes post-classical music into avant-garde electronic and cinematic realms, inviting listeners into a space of introspection, healing, and sensory immersion.",

With a raw emotional honesty and a sound rooted in emo rap and alternative pop, he has become a defining figure in the post-Gen-Z youth culture of the German-speaking world. Born and raised in a small town in northern Germany, t-low emerged from SoundCloud culture and quickly gained nationwide attention with his unfiltered lyrics and melodic sensibility. His music explores themes of mental health, love, identity, and existential struggle delivered with a rare vulnerability that resonates deeply with his audience.\n\nWith multiple gold and platinum records, sold-out tours, and chart-topping singles, t-low has established himself as a generational voice in Germany. Yet despite his commercial success, he has consistently pushed boundaries and stayed artistically uncompromising. In late 2025, t-low will release his highly anticipated comeback album \"REAL MUSIC\", marking a return to his roots with a more introspective, emotionally complex sound. His showcase at SXSW 2026 is not about breaking into the U.S. market - it’s a statement.",

    "description": "For the past 10 years, Theo Lawrence has been making a name for himself as France's favorite songbird. A truly one-of-a-kind country singer and genuine keeper of the flame, Lawrence came into his own on his Austin-made 2023 LP release, Cherie, and on his all-acoustic album, Pickin' & Singin'. His most recent release, a duet All Fifty States (with Melissa Carper), is a playful back-and-forth about two people in love who don’t always see eye to eye. It's a perfect showcase of storytelling, connection, and the artistry Theo brings to every song.\n\nLawrence pens classic love songs and delivers with a croon straight out of the Charlie Rich and Ray Price golden years. In recent years, he has played a pivotal role in reviving an interest for Country Music in Europe, and with his recent move to Austin, TX, Theo Lawrence is bringing his honed craft back to its American cradle.\n\nNewly signed to Warner Records, we expect to hear Theo's name a lot more in the coming months and years.",

    "description": "Come Back Down, the new album by Nashville experimental-pop duo Total Wife, was born from the edge of sleep. When composer and producer Luna Kupper would begin to fall asleep during late-night mixing sessions, the songs would follow her into the halfway place between dream and lucidity. Like Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks, she’d wake with a new perspective on the puzzle she was piecing together. “I’m a psychological mixer — I’m trying to think of how someone’s experiencing the sound, versus getting stuck in trying to make all these different tones and using all this gear to make something sound a certain way,” Kupper says.\n\nAnd like a spiral from waking life into dream, the songs on Come Back Down are endlessly self- referential, building whole universes from a single point. Kupper sold all of her synths to make rent before she started working on the album, and so every inorganic sound is instead built from samples of the band’s own work. A guitar on one song may be reprocessed and used as a synth on the next, while everywhere on the album vocal samples are taken from a single unreleased cover of Elliott Smith’s “Between the Bars.” In tribute to this process, the album was almost named The Julia Set after the mathematical equation which feeds into itself again and again, creating beautiful fractal images. The intention was to create something complex but accessible; experimental, yet precise and without abstraction.",

    "description": "Born and raised in Mobile, Alabama, Trim’s journey into music began after an unexpected exit from Division I football and college. What started as freestyling with friends during downtime evolved into a serious pursuit once his raw ability stood out, leading him to record music on BandLab. Early releases gained traction through TikTok music reviews, earning co-signs from Sonny Digital, Ray Daniels, and DJ Plugg —momentum that culminated in the release of his breakout single, Down the Pole.",

    "description": "True Jackson is an independent artist who blends 90s grunge rock production with an anthemic pop vocal. A native of Los Angeles, True has been embraced by the vibrant New York music scene, having performed at such legendary venues as the Mercury Lounge, Baby’s All Right, and Le Poisson Rouge, to name a few.\nTrue channels her emotions into catchy hooks and electrifying guitar riffs, painting a clear picture of where she has been and where she’s going with her debut song: “Paint Me”, released in 2024 and featured in the American High film, 'Prom Dates', streaming on Hulu.\nTrue’s debut EP, RIP TRUE, was released in 2025 and features standouts “Smooth Talking” and “Bad”. Making music for the crashout girlies, these 4 songs encapsulate struggling with self-doubt and navigating out of her youth into her 20’s, allowing the audience to scream and dance through life, embracing the imperfections instead of sitting in it.\nHer follow-up project explores a toxic relationship and how the heroine ultimately regains her power. The project will be released in Spring 2026 with two lead singles coming just before she takes Austin, TX by storm as part of this year’s South by Southwest Festival.",

Known for conjuring vast, atmospheric worlds from her bedroom using just Garageband, she watched as early releases like her Warhol-inspired 2024 EP “Me, Jed and Andy” picked up steam. Since then, she’s traded bedrooms for stages supporting Kim Deal, English Teacher, Soccer Mommy and Mannequin Pussy, plus sold out headlines across the UK and packed festival sets from Green Man to the Great Escape.",

    "description": "The amalgamation of four distinct voices from Adelaide, The Tullamarines tell their stories through a shared perspective that feels intimate, honest, and quietly uplifting. Josh, Angus, Benny and Lucinda met on the local gig circuit, quickly bonding over a mutual love of songwriting and collaboration. From those early connections, they’ve crafted a sound that reflects each member’s individual sensibilities - a style they affectionately call cosy-pop.\n\nTheir songs move through life’s highs and lows with the warmth of an old friend, inviting listeners into their living room, putting the kettle on, and sitting with whatever feeling the day brings. That sense of closeness runs through both their recorded work and their live shows.\n\nHaving appeared on festival line-ups including Beyond The Valley, Laneway Festival, Spin Off Festival and New Year’s Eve on the Hill, and toured extensively alongside artists such as Old Mervs, The Preatures, Ball Park Music and Alex Lahey, The Tullamarines continue to build a reputation for heartfelt songwriting and deeply human performances.",

    "description": "A post-punk project out of Brooklyn NY, Two-Man Giant Squid has earned acclaim in the New York City underground for their ability to fuse dance-punk, garage, and psych influences into fierce live shows and ambitious recordings (KEXP, SPIN). They lean on an eclectic mix to produce their sound including matter-of-fact vocal delivery, intricate synth design, and lately- a theremin. Their most recent LP was unveiled at last year’s SXSW festival and later charted at #89 on National Indie Radio charts. With a slate of releases & tours planned for 2026, Two-Man Giant Squid brings their signature creativity and DIY spirit to the forefront of the post-punk revival.",

    "description": "Unsafe Space Garden is a genre-bending outfit from Portugal known for their chaotic, theatrical and deeply immersive live shows. With a sound rooted in neo-psychedelia, experimental rock and a touch of surreal humour, the band pushes musical boundaries with fearless creativity and a clear artistic vision.\n\nDescribed by European press as “a surrealist orchestra,” their concerts often blur the line between performance and ritual - unpredictable, cathartic and strangely uplifting. Their critically acclaimed albums Bro, You Got Something In Your Eye – A Guided Meditation (2021) and Where’s The Ground? (2023) draw comparisons to artists like Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart or The Flaming Lips, while forging a language uniquely their own.\n\nMore than just experimentalists, Unsafe Space Garden are storytellers - unpredictable, emotional and sonically adventurous. A live act designed to be seen, heard, and remembered.",

Valee’s sound is defined by sparse beats, unconventional flows, and an anti-performative cool that has influenced a wave of modern rap aesthetics. He’s collaborated and shared stages with artists across the experimental and mainstream rap spectrum, earning a reputation as a tastemaker’s rapper with lasting cultural impact rather than trend-chasing appeal.",

Victor comes from a background of comedy and theater as much as music, and it shows through even (especially?) in his darkest songs.\n\nVictor plays with a modular backing band consisting of 1-2 people and carefully arranged backing tracks. His shows are high energy, danceable, and chantable. He prides himself on having, at least in the past year, made people cry at every show, and alternately, made them dance.",

    "description": "Victoryland is the Brooklyn-based project of musician Julian McCamman. His label-debut, My Heart Is A Room With No Cameras In It, out January 23, 2026 via Good English, is a triumphant, despondent, and ultimately fun experimental pop-rock album. Victoryland started in Philly 2023 with the release of tape, Sprain, which echoed more of what the Philly scene was dishing out: lo-fi, tape-recorded rock with a capital R. It was the collaborative efforts of producer Dan Howard that brought the new vision and sound into full focus.Dan and Julian previously worked on Julian’s now-defunct Texas-to-Philly based band, Blood’s Loving You Backwards LP, a collaborative effort between six bandmates. That experience pushed Julian toward a more personal process of recording, starting with home demos and then bringing them to Dan to shape into songs. This relationship ultimately led Julian to move to NYC.\n\nThe sound of the album, recorded between Julian’s Bed Stuy basement and Dan’s Williamsburg studio, is the sound of a bright and beaming collaboration. Landing somewhere between lo-fi and hi-fi production, the songs have the glossiness of a radio-friendly hit mixed with the distortion and rough edges of a home demo. Every song keeps at least one element of the initial recording, while building around the loops and half-songs Julian scrapped together. The lyrics on the record span from humorous self-aware popisms (“‘you and I’ will soon be, used to be ‘us’”) to crushing realities of bitterness(“i’ll never forgive you, that’s how I keep you close”) to abstract imagery (“mothers wave from doorways, in ostinato”), all delivered with such an immediacy and fervor that in the middle of singing along, you wonder if this guy slept much last night.\n\nMy Heart wrangles with heavy subject matter (love, disconnection, sexual frustration, emptiness etc.), but the terminal statement of the record is about the cleansing nature of pop music. That, if a song can force you to “bliss out” over a hook or a loop, or even make you dance, it can be the spoonful of sugar to swallow the hard pill with; this is what Victoryland strives to do: package the most exhausting realities of life, love, and the search for connection in a world starved of it, into a fun 2-5 minutes, and for the runtime of Victoryland’s first major statement, you might even feel like you’re not alone.",

Austin based rapper and DJ has risen up to speak for a section of Austin that has rarely had a voice. Blending tales from the streets with very poignant bars of consciousness and social reform. Vintage Jay was featured on KUTX radio September Artist of the month and KUTX Summer Jam. Making him an official NPR Session artist. The city of Austin has also given Jay his official proclamation date September 12th. From producing cultural and musical events to as well expressing his life through music. Jay has become an individual of many traits, his latest album Still I Rise, speaks of a new age of creativity and musical expression to the ear. His growth in his music is something that appears in every album, and one thing that never changes is that he stays true to himself and the craft. Jay has become a true tastemaker and one of the biggest Latino figures in Austin, TX. To represent the Latino culture with pride and honor is something Jay has done since day 1.",

Built from the ground up, his rise reflects a disciplined approach to music, pairing raw street perspective with elite level production and proven performance metrics.\n\nAfter building organic traction online, Wacotron’s momentum accelerated through his affiliation with Pick Six Records, where his sound sharpened and his reach expanded. His breakout phase was defined by collaborations with producers from the 808 Mafia camp, resulting in hard hitting releases that generated millions of views and streams across digital platforms. These records didn’t just circulate, they converted, placing Wacotron in front of a national audience and solidifying his market viability.\n\nAnchored by dark, bass driven production and a commanding delivery, Wacotron’s catalog speaks directly to trap culture while maintaining crossover appeal. His visuals and singles consistently perform at scale across YouTube and streaming services, reflecting a growing fanbase and long term positioning in today’s dominant trap landscape.",

    "description": "“Arguably the most exciting rock band to emerge from the American experimental underground this decade.” - Grayson Haver Currin, MOJO Magazine 2025\n\nDrones are a powerful force, capable of whisking our thinking mind far, far, away. Austin-based collective Water Damage yields the same power whenever they pick up their instruments. Veterans from other projects (a.o. Swans, more eaze, Spray Paint, USA/Mexico and more), the band is not unfamiliar with the unshakeable power in drones; still, as Water Damage, they stretch out drone’s possibilities to their limits, bowing to the principle ‘Maximal Repetition Minimal Deviation’. Water Damage explore ecstatic oblivion, repeating basic riffs and rhythms until time seems to falter. Once an idea takes off, they pursue it forever; as Pitchfork said, their 2024 double LP ‘In E’ doubles as a “glorious mind eraser”.",

    "description": "Werkha (aka Tom Leah) is a multi-instrumentalist, producer & DJ hailing from Manchester and Cumbria. He has been consistently releasing music and creating live experiences for over a decade. Werkha’s music fuses analogue jazz-funk vibes with the UK’s electronic, resulting in a number of releases nestled between the sounds of broken beat and cinematic moments. Deep synths and delectable drums ride alongside live horns and a wealth of string textures. Shortly after his track “Sidesteppin” was picked up by Gilles Peterson for his Brownswood Bubblers compilation, Werkha’s debut landed on the acclaimed Brighton imprint Tru Thoughts. He went on to sign to the Worldwide Award-winning First Word Records, releasing his self-produced sophomore album ‘All Werk Is Play’ in 2022. This featured collabs with MC Chunky (Eglo Records / Swamp 81), Ellen Beth Abdi (A Certain Ratio), Kemani Anderson (Secret Night Gang), Nick Blacka (GoGo Penguin) and Tom Driessler (Tom Misch / Jordan Rakei) amongst others.\n\nHis vibrant energetic live shows include a selection of instruments, looped and fused with a mix of tightly packed samples that set the moment alight, blending beauty and dance.",

    "description": "Featuring five musicians who grew up in El Paso, Lubbock and Amarillo, the West Texas Exiles draw upon the wide-open western reaches of the Lone Star State with a wide-ranging, Americana-centered sound. Rising from the embers of the Dirty River Boys, which Marco Gutierrez co-founded in 2009, the Austin band features a triple-threat of songwriters in Gutierrez, Daniel Davis and Colin Gilmore (son of legendary Texas troubadour Jimmie Dale Gilmore), plus seasoned bassist/producer Eric Harrison and latter-day Dirty River Boys drummer Trinidad Leal. The Exiles' 2023 debut EP paved the way for their first full-length album, 8000 Days. Since its September release the album has steadily risen to #8 on the Americana radio charts and has drawn critical praise. The recordings build upon the live chops the group has honed through a weekly residency at Austin’s legendary Continental Club plus gigs at key local events such as SXSW and Willie Nelson’s Luck Reunion, as well as high-profile touring appearances at Nashville’s Americanafest, Braun Brothers Reunion and San Francisco’s Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival.",

    "description": "Originally inspired by a Slowdive KEXP session, London-based quartet Whitelands fuse their diverse musical backgrounds into an updated spin on shoegaze that amplifies marginalized voices and perspectives. Formed in the late 2010s as the solo project of Etienne Quartey-Papafio, Whitelands evolved into a full band ahead of their official debut album, Night-Bound Eyes Are Blind to the Day (2024), released during a U.K. tour with Slowdive. The project takes its name from a campus at London’s Roehampton University, where Quartey-Papafio first performed live. Their self-titled 2018 debut, a lo-fi blend of jagged indie rock and hazy grunge textures, hinted at the immersive sound they would later embrace. A turning point came when Quartey-Papafio stumbled upon Slowdive’s 2017 KEXP performance, igniting a deeper fixation on shoegaze. The current lineup consists of Jagun Meseorisa, Vanessa Govinden, and Michael Adelaja who bonded through shared experiences of neurodivergence and racial identity. Whitelands’ forthcoming album, Sunlight Echoes (out January 30, 2026), expands their sound, moving beyond shoegaze’s shadows toward something bigger, brighter, and unmistakably their own.",

    "description": "Jersey-born Maria Crawford has been paving her way through the Nashville independent music scene since 2014. Now Brooklyn-based, she continues to capture listeners with her fiercely vulnerable songwriting and compelling live performances. Wilby’s debut single “Bad” (2020) gained immediate attention, followed by \"Translucent Beauty” (2021), drifting between bedroom pop and indie rock. Her sophomore EP, “Happiest Woman” (2023), marked a shift toward showcasing a full-band production, mirroring the force of Wilby’s live sound. Wilby’s debut album, “Center of Affection” (2025, via Hit the North Records), explores both the cathartic side of indie-rock and the vulnerable side of twangy folk. Wilby has been featured in FLOOD Magazine, Luna Collective, and Ones To Watch, named an Artist to Watch by Atwood Magazine, with support from Seattle’s KEXP and Nashville’s WNXP and Lightning 100.",

    "description": "Willgood has now been DJing long enough that the original plan to fund a nationwide automotive repainting initiative exclusively in red has been officially downgraded from “ambitious” to “symbolic.” What started as a financial experiment became a long-term commitment to dance floors, tasteful grooves, and basslines that behave like they know what they’re doing.\n\nStill operating without formal mentorship (DJ Pagliacci remains legally unreachable), Willgood approaches DJing as a serious craft with unserious presentation favoring disco, house, and dance music that sneaks up on you, locks in, and refuses to rush. Still has the long term goal of being the 4th member of Being Dead. He loves Ferraris, not because they’re fast, but because they’re precise, opinionated, and allergic to subtlety.\n\nThe hat is gone. The red remains. Catch Willgood at SXSW doing what he does best: keeping it fun, keeping it moving, and quietly convincing you this was always the plan.",

    "description": "Missouri native willoh is riding the crest of a wave of excitement over her new series of singles leading up to her spring 2026 album release. On her latest track, EARMILK writes ““OUCHIE” defies easy categorization, blending synth-pop, raw punk attitude, and alt-rock vibes into a shifting, avant-garde sound.”\n\nWilloh’s self-produced 20205 debut, not more than that, but more please presents us with a raw honesty rendered through snowy vocals that sit in rarefied air and belies the artist’s 19 years. In September she released the labyrinthine “Buckshot” to critical acclaim.\n\nFrom her home in Springfield, Missouri, willoh records and creates music, having first found her footing on Garageband before graduating to LogicPro–making the upgrade from her earnings working many long shifts at McDonalds.",

    "description": "Based in Athens, Georgia, Wim Tapley came of age playing venues in Washington D.C. and its sprawling suburbs. There, he honed his voice with the passion of a born troubadour, drawing in a diverse fanbase with his easy showmanship and distinct style.\n\nSince 2021, Athens has been home to Wim and his live band The Cannons. His first week in town, Wim made his way onto a local bill, etching a name for himself as a fresh and favorite hometown voice. He is ardently received by his ever-growing following at legendary regional venues like the 9:30 Club, Eddie’s Attic, and the Georgia Theatre—the latter of which he’s sold out more than once—and on tours across the country.\n\nFirmly rooted in Americana and dashed with glamorous pop sensibilities, the swinging depths of neo-soul, and a sprinkling of riotous horns, Wim’s arresting sound is as fresh as it is ageless, as fevered as it is raucous fun.\n\nA sonic westward expansion of fuzzed-out guitars, defiant horns, and dusty vocals, his discography blazes a fresh new take on folk-pop while honoring the songwriting giants that paved the way before him like Jason Isbell, Bill Withers, and Chris Stapleton.",

The new LP, released via tastemaker labels Smoking Room and Julia’s War Records, mixed and mastered by Jack Shirley, features standout singles like \"Angus,\" “Gas Hands” and the 2024 track “Motor Mouth.” On American Muscle, the band takes new risks and showcases how they have grown as songwriters while maintaining their noisy, ‘90s rock style. Worlds Worst has toured extensively across the US, headlined Philly's Julia's War Fest, performed at SLC's Kilby Block Party twice, played the new Best Friends Forever Festival in Las Vegas, Boise’s Treefort Fest, and earned recognition as one of Stereogum’s Best New Bands.",

    "description": "YARD are the electrifying three-piece electropunk band from Dublin. Known for their intense and immersive live shows, YARD bridges the gap between electronica and post-punk, creating an auditory onslaught that leaves audiences sweaty, energised, and strangely unnerved.\n\nSince their inception, YARD has shared stages with the likes of A Place To Bury Strangers, Psychotic Monks and Mandy Indiana. Their electrifying live performances, akin to Death Grips, Nine Inch Nails and The Prodigy, have earned them coveted slots at festivals such as Les Transmusicales, Haldern Pop and Into The Great Wide Open.\n\nWith a recent live performance on KEXP, continued support from Rolling Stone, BBC Radio 6, Clash and Louder Than War among others and two self-titled EPs under their belt, YARD are set to continue their meteoric rise in 2026.\n\nA recent live review captured the YARD experience perfectly: “In their presence, you see and feel them painstakingly crafting every note and sound with their bare hands, wrestling with different sockets, switches, strings, or even their voices. The venue was transformed into this factory of raw, unadulterated noise which kept us all at the mercy of the sound - collectively banging our heads in synchronicity.”",

    "description": "Born amidst the cultural vibrancy of Glasgow and Paris, YES AND MAYBE is an electrifying two-piece band that pushes the boundaries of contemporary music.\n\nThe first band member, a multi-instrumentalist and writer, excels in crafting minimalist guitar-based melodies, demonstrating a perfect blend of ingenuity and precision. His obsessive self-criticism and penchant for perfection have allowed him to transform his influences into his own unique sound.\n\nThe second member, a performer, writer, and producer, brings his experiences and emotions to life through introspective lyrics paired with evocative, ethereal vocals. His artistry lies in balancing deeply metaphorical, grounded lyrics with melodies that evoke a sense of escapism. This potent mix of realism and fantasy forms an integral part of YES AND MAYBE's distinctive sound.\n​\nTheir songwriting process, both organic and instinctive, evolves from a simple phrase or a recorded sound into a comprehensive musical piece within a day. Their songs encapsulate their raw emotions, serving as a beacon of authenticity in an industry often mired in overproduction.\n\nYES AND MAYBE, though relatively new, brings a refreshing spontaneity and a shared vision to redefine the musical landscape. Their commitment to creating music that resonates with their listeners' shared experiences makes them a band worth investing in. Keep an eye on this Glasgow based duo—they're a unique proposition with a future as innovative as their sound.",

    "description": "The Bantu & Boundless artist, Zola Marcelle, is a Zimbabwean-born, London-based multidisciplinary artist. With a rare mix of Shona and Sotho heritage, her journey through music, culture, and history is steadily shaping her into an exciting contemporary voice of her generation. Raised partially in Bulawayo with a family steeped in music, Zola grew up with a deep connection to song and her African roots.\n\nBelonging to a generation of active participants in Zimbabwe’s independence struggle, Zola adopted a profound sense of responsibility, identity, and freedom. Having grown up in a home where music was a staple diet, Zola was surrounded by the global sounds of legends like Sankomota, Andrae Crouch, Stevie Wonder, Jimmy Dludlu and Sibongile Khumalo. When she wasn’t listening to these musical greats, Zola would accompany her father on photography outings, a combination of visual and sonic inspiration that would later fuel her own creative process. These early experiences gave her a foundation in both artistry and activism.",
