    "description": "0 Miles Per Hour is a loud, fuzzy, in your face rock band hailing from Orlando Florida. The group has just released their most recent project \"Gallop\" through Chicago-based label New Morality Zine. The EP captures the band in a moment of clarity and growth. Across five songs they channel the energy of alternative rock through a hazy, melodic lens. \"Gallop\" represents 0 Miles Per Hour\u2019s most confident and fully realized work to date.",

    "description": "Aaron Page is an emerging force in contemporary R&B whose music is as heartfelt as it is captivating. His journey began early, watching his older brother perform in a high school quartet and singing at talent shows during summers spent at his family\u2019s camp. Early on, those cafeteria performances sparked a love for music that deepened with time. Aaron\u2019s artistic foundation was laid at a music and arts academy in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he became the lead vocalist in a jazz ensemble and honed his understanding of song structure. It was there he realized music wasn\u2019t just a passion \u2013 it was his purpose. Drawing inspiration from icons like Drake, Kanye West, John Mayer, Ryan Leslie, The Weeknd, and Michael Jackson, Aaron developed a sound that is moody, melodic, and emotionally raw. R&B runs deep in Aaron\u2019s veins \u2013 it\u2019s the core of his identity and the soundtrack of his upbringing. His lyrics are rooted in personal experiences and the world around him, unafraid to be vulnerable and honest. That sincerity resonates in tracks like \u201cPretty Girls Love R&B\u201d \u2013 a breakout hit celebrating women and creating a vibe that\u2019s both comforting and confident. Aaron has already left his mark on major stages nationwide, joining R&B heavyweights PARTYNEXTDOOR on the Sorry I\u2019m Outside Tour and Bryson Tiller on the Back and Better Tour as an opening act. Whether on stage or in the studio, Aaron moves with love and intention, using music as both an escape and a celebration. Most recently, Aaron released his new EP, Before I Go \u2013 a sultry, rain-soaked sonic experience that offers a glimpse into his evolving style. With smooth melodies and infectious rhythms, the project is perfect for summer nights, late drives, and moments of reflection. It\u2019s a boundary-pushing body of work that positions him as a distinctive voice in modern R&B. Now, he\u2019s stepping boldly into the spotlight \u2013 bringing a fresh, emotionally rich perspective to R&B while honoring the genre\u2019s timeless soul.",

    "description": "Adult DVD, the Leeds based six piece have become known for their relentless output of euphoric hooks and grooves along with a relentless touring schedule that has taken them to Glastonbury, Greenman, End Of The Road and several European festivals this Summer.\nFormed by vocalist Harry Hanson and synth-player Greg Lonsdale, the project quickly expanded to a full band with Danny Blackburn (guitar/synth), Jake Williams (synth), Jonathan Newell (drums), and George Manson (bass). From the outset, their tongue-in-cheek lyrics, pulsating electronics, big choruses and unique production style (their releases are all self-produced) set them apart from the indie-rock landscape.\nFew songs capture the chaotic fun of Adult DVD more than their first release \u2018Bill Murray\u2019 - now a firm fan favourite and sing along moment at every festival set. First \u2018proper\u2019 single \u2018Do Something\u2019 from their 'Next Day Shipping' EP earned a spot on the BBC 6 Music B-list and support from BBC Radio 1, BBC Introducing and Radio X. Subsequent single \u2018Because I Like It\u2019 also landed onto the 6 Music B-list, and accompanying live performance from the BBC\u2019s 6 Music festival.\nAdult DVD\u2019s live shows are fast becoming legendary. From sold-out hometown headline gigs at Brudenell Social Club and Belgrave Music Hall (2 in the round shows in one day) to storming sets at The Great Escape, Deer Shed Festival, and Live at Leeds, their performances are high-energy and unmissable.\nWhether tapping into their love for chorus-centric indie or the influence of acid house floor fillers, DJing, or remixing their musical contemporaries their core appeal remains consistent: undeniable humour, bold danceable instrumentals and instantly memorable songwriting.\"",

    "description": "Formed in the lockdown winter of 2021, Agatha Is Dead! began as a post-punk experiment between longtime friends Lilly and Noah, who first made music together in their school days. Their shared love for Joy Division, The Cure, Molchat Doma, and Fontaines D.C. laid the foundation for their darkly urgent sound. With the addition of drummer Joey Ramone Hansen\u2212bringing grunge and pop\u2212punk bite\u2212and Arthur on bass, the band played their first shows in 2022 and quickly carved out a place in Berlin's underground scene.\n\nThe band signed to Berlin label Duchess Box Records in May 2025 and will release their debut EP \"order\" in on 10th October.\n\nThe first singles drew attention from big online magazines such as Post-Punk.com and Diffus as well as major radio station airplay and big playlist support from Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nThis September, the band will embark on their first-ever headline tour with shows in Berlin and Leipzig selling out in advance., marking a new chapter in their journey. Their Berlin show at Privatclub sold out an incredible five months in advance, underscoring the growing excitement surrounding the band.\n\nDrawing further inspiration from The Pretty Reckless, DIIV, Liily, and Bloc Party, Agatha Is Dead! have honed a sound that is heavy, hypnotic, and deeply emotional. With their debut EP Order on the horizon, the band are staking their claim in the next wave of alternative rock\u2212grabbing hearts, shaking stages, and refusing to go unnoticed.",

    "description": "\u201cWe have never seen a proposal even remotely similar to that of Ain TheMachine.\u201d \u2014 DJ Mag\n\nAin TheMachine is a Grammy-nominated Brazilian artist based in Berlin whose work reimagines how electronic music is made and performed. Instead of conventional instruments, he creates music live from the body, the voice and everyday objects, working across genres from Brazilian downtempo to Techno. His shows and videos often break the fourth wall, inviting the audience to contribute sounds that become part of the piece.\n\nHis unique approach has drawn international attention: he has been featured in one of Beatport\u2019s most viewed and commented posts and has performed at iconic clubs and festivals such as Fusion Festival (Germany), Sisyphos (Berlin), D-EDGE (Brazil) and Suma Han (Turkey). Supported by artists including Purple Disco Machine, Sam Divine and Mano Le Tough, he releases music on his label Mundo Afora Records and on respected imprints such as Black Book.\n\nHe has delivered four TEDx talks in three countries, played with Prince\u2019s guitarist Miko Weaver, jammed with Bobby McFerrin, and had his productions remixed by Mad Professor.",

    "description": "AKA BK is an alternative indie project based in Los Angeles. With influences from bands like The Pixies, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and the Breeders, their live show plays like nerves exposed: charged, joyful and disarmingly human, turning their vulnerability into sharpened momentum. The band closes the distance between their fans, both literally and figuratively, inviting them to join in on their tongue-in-cheek moments of mushy playfulness and feverish moshing.\n\nThe foundation of AKA BK is built on long standing friendships, with BK (lead vocals) and Cecile Herledan (bassist) forming their first band at the age of 11 in Metro Detroit. The band is rounded out by fellow guitarists Julian Cullars and Sean Gunner Lee, who have been playing in LA bands since 2013.",

    "description": "Born Akira Galaxy Ament, the 24-year-old singer cut her teeth as a musician while fronting high school bands in Seattle, having been steeped in eclectic music by her family since she was a toddler. In her songwriting and performance, she combines the grit and attitude of the alt-rock of her hometown\u2014where she often retreats to write\u2014with a sleeker, more transatlantic aesthetic. Aided by producers Chris Coady (Beach House, TV On the Radio, The Kills) and Sam Westhoff, the songs on the EP blend rock \u2019n\u2019 roll edge with synth gestures reminiscent of \u201980s dream pop. Akira\u2019s smoky vocals feel intimate and otherworldly at the same time, mirroring the moments in her songs when the real and the imagined seem to fold together and become inextricable.\n\nUltimately, Akira hopes her songs will connect with people who have gone through experiences similar to hers and effectively describe inner states that feel difficult to articulate\u2014for instance, the desire for complete knowledge of another person. In the most powerful moments on What\u2019s Inside You, she writes about our strange proclivities in love without judgment. These indelible songs capture emotional truth\u2014the bold handiwork of an artist who prizes depth and substance in addition to her adventurous sounds.",

Factory\u2014proof of her rare ability to command both national stages and underground culture. She\u2019s shared bills with top international acts, earned wide media attention, and continues to push Ukrainian sound into global pop and bass ecosystems.\n\nIn March she drops a deluxe release with 15 remix features\u2014largely U.S. collaborators\u2014bridging her world into American scenes.

    "description": "Alkyone is a Greek singer-songwriter hailing from the mountains of northern Greece. Born and raised in a small town surrounded by rivers and forests, she began her musical journey at the age of six, training as a classical pianist, before embracing songwriting as her true path.\nInfluenced by her father\u2019s deep love for folk music, Alkyone began experimenting with traditional songs and textures, weaving a distinct folklore thread into her musical identity. Her sound blends indie songwriting, cinematic atmospheres, and folk elements from the Mediterranean and the Balkans. Singing in both English and Greek, her lyrics explore memory, growing up, and our evolving relationship with the world, while her concerts carry an intimate, personal, and emotionally charged atmosphere.\nShe has performed across Europe (Konzerthaus, Tonhalle, Carr\u00e9, SNF, Onassis Foundation and others). In 2023, she collaborated with Vincent Moon and was featured on La Blogoth\u00e8que. Her critically acclaimed debut album Exit Sign was released in 2023, while her second studio album, Small Philosophies, is expected in late spring 2026.\nHer stage name, Alkyone, is a tribute to a recurring dream in which she was a bird.",

Formed in 2024, the band is lead by Coc\u00f3 Allegra and produced by Ernesto Grey (credits with Font, Farmer\u2019s Wife, The Opera, Almost Heaven, etc). Coc\u00f3, a Panamanian immigrant, settled in Austin five years ago. It wasn\u2019t until she met collaborator, Ernesto, that she fully committed to writing and performing live. The band\u2019s sound is inspired by 90\u2019s icons such as Bjork and contemporaries like FKA Twigs and Rosalia. Through their live performances, Coc\u00f3 aims to highlight and lift up the queer and Latino community.\n\nThe band\u2019s debut EP, \u201cDeseo un Brillo\u201d, was released on October 24, 2025. Since then they\u2019ve continued building momentum in the Austin scene by opening for bands such as Sextile and Snooper. The band is in the process of relocating to Brooklyn, NY, where they hope to expand on their already defined sound and fanbase.",

A proud queer voice in pop, he celebrates freedom, reinvention, and the art of moving at your own speed.",

Born of French heritage in\u00a0South East London, Amie cut her teeth in community projects growing up - ArtsTrain, Flames Collective \u2013 whilst developing her sound, and sense of self, across 2024 mixtape how we lose. Introspective but frank, songs like \u2018everything about her\u2019 showed a poetic brand of realism - and soulful, stop-you-in-your-tracks voice - way beyond Amie Blu\u2019s years.\u00a0Since then, Amie has opened for Joy Crookes, Jacob Banks, Faye Webster and sold-out her own headline dates as she builds up to 2025's debut album, when all is said and done. Featuring acclaimed singles like 'swimming in pity', 'shadow', and 'missing everything', it's a record drenched in feeling; startling explorations of love, loss, depression and human connection, but ultimately about the relationship with the self. Far from an exploration of endings, when all is said and done is the start of something truly special from Amie Blu.",

    "description": "amri fuses her Indian roots into putting a spin on her much-loved Soul and R&B to create a fresh, new, jazzy, colourful sound. Branching into a range of sounds built in Carnatic melodies, amri balances relatable lyrics to a fun, fresh groove. Born and primarily brought up in London alongside Guernsey, she draws from these experiences in her writing. With so many inspirations she branches from, her soulful, sweet melodies will surely hold a piece of something you love and play over in your head!\n\nShe touches on her exposure in the world as a young woman of colour, translating this into getting you to feel, sing and move with her. Her debut EP \u2018grooves in a SMILE\u2019 invites you into her world to feel, sing and move with her. Having been interviewed on BBC Bristol\u2019s Breakfast show, songs featured on BBC Introducing Radio and showcased in RESONATE and KICKDRUM magazines, amri has been gaining attention, and seems not to be slowing down.\nNow based in Bristol with her band, her blend of the smooth, sultry edges of jazz and soul, combined with brass and sitar, creates a unique fusion that\u2019s not one to miss..",

    "description": "As a bassist, vocalist, and composer, my journey as a music creator has been shaped by my rich cultural heritage and passion for blending traditional jazz with contemporary influences. I grew up in the suburbs of Paris, born to parents of Senegalese, Gambian, and Malian descent. This background continues to inspire my artistry, which merges the sounds of jazz legends like Betty Carter and Wayne Shorter with the soulful rhythms of artists such as D\u2019Angelo and Stevie Wonder.\n\nSince moving to London at 18 to study double bass at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, I have built a strong live track record, performing at renowned festivals and venues including the EFG London Jazz Festival, Jazz Caf\u00e9, Cheltenham Jazz Festival, We Out Here, Brick Lane Jazz Festival, and Pizza Express Soho. These experiences have been pivotal in building my fanbase and establishing my presence in the UK. Internationally I have performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival and countries around the world including France, Poland , South Korea and more.",

The singer\u2019s straightforward lack of pretension speaks from the vantage point of the outsider\u2014 and, often \u2014 the sounds of the unspoken.",

    "description": "Following the release of her 2023 EP Hey Anna, a breakup, and a move, Anna Shoemaker\u2019s 2025 album 'Someone Should Stop Her' marked the start of a transformative new chapter for her. Known for her alt-leaning production, intoxicating pop melodies, and unflinching lyricism, Anna\u2019s music vividly captures the turbulence, charm, and self-reflection of young adulthood. Recorded in Nashville, the album captures her personal evolution as she embraces a fresh, stripped-back sound, moving beyond the synth-heavy production that defined her debut album Everything Is Fine (I\u2019m Only On Fire).",

    "description": "Babatunde Akinboboye is an internationally celebrated Nigerian-American baritone and the pioneering force behind Hip Hopera\u2014a bold, genre-defying fusion of classical opera and hip-hop. With a powerful operatic voice and magnetic stage presence, Babatunde merges centuries-old vocal mastery with the cultural pulse of modern Black music, creating a sound that is as revolutionary as it is resonant.\nBorn of Nigerian descent and classically trained in Western opera, Babatunde\u2019s unique cultural and musical background fuels his mission to make opera more accessible and culturally relevant. His breakout moment came in 2018 when he went viral for blending Rossini\u2019s Largo al Factotum with Kendrick Lamar\u2019s HUMBLE\u2014a performance that amassed over 10 million views and earned global media coverage from TIME, MSN, and Classic FM.\n\nSince then, Babatunde has refined Hip Hopera into a distinct artistic movement, captivating audiences across the world through both digital platforms and live performance. With a loyal global following in the millions, he has become a cultural influencer who is using his voice\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014to expand the boundaries of what opera can be.\nHis classical r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is just as compelling. He has performed lead roles with renowned companies such as Los Angeles Opera, Detroit Opera, and Utah Opera, including standout performances in The Central Park Five, Carmen, and Faust. A passionate advocate for African and African American composers, Babatunde brings visibility and vitality to voices often excluded from the classical canon.\n\nFollowing his successful City Winery tour, Babatunde is preparing to release his debut studio album and headline an international tour in 2026\u2014a showcase of how Hip Hopera continues to evolve as both an art form and a cultural bridge.",

    "description": "\u201cDreamlike.\u201d \u201cPoetic.\u201d \u201cBeautiful.\u201d \u2014 this is how audiences describe B\u00e1ra Zmekov\u00e1\u2019s performances.\nThe moment she steps on stage, intimacy and imagination take over. A Prague-based singer, pianist and composer, she draws from the rich Czech singer-songwriter tradition while blending it with modern jazz and subtle electronics, creating music that feels both deeply rooted and strikingly contemporary.\nHer expression is civil yet emotionally powerful, inviting listeners into an inner world shaped by melody, atmosphere and nuance. Although she sings in Czech, language is never a barrier; the natural rhythm and softness of the language add a distinctive colour to her sound. Audiences across Europe and Japan consistently respond beyond words.\nHer trio moves between quiet minimalism and expressive intensity, built on strong melodies and precise interplay.\nThe critically acclaimed Lunaves established her as one of the distinctive voices of the contemporary Czech scene. In 2024 came the album Jedin\u00fd na sv\u011bt\u011b, followed by the single Jin\u00e9 stromy, recorded with Norwegian tubist Daniel Herskedal.\nFollowing their second Japan tour in early 2026, the trio heads to SXSW directly from Tokyo.",

In the making of his latest body of work, the Austin-based artist/producer/multi-instrumentalist otherwise known as Roger Sellers found himself in even greater need of an outlet for his kinetic creative impulses, thanks to an intense convergence of events in his personal life: his father\u2019s diagnosis with and eventual death from cancer, the end of a significant relationship, and an overwhelming struggle with depression and anxiety. Deeply informed by a deliberate transformation of his musical process, Bayonne\u2019s third full-length Temporary Time ultimately makes for his most expansive work to date\u2014an album of both painfully raw introspection and otherworldly beauty.",

    "description": "At just 23, Cardiff-born singer-songwriter Ben Ellis has become one of the UK\u2019s most quietly magnetic new voices, blending intimate acoustic songwriting with the emotional depth of indie-pop. His upcoming third EP marks a pivotal moment both emotionally and musically. Written across two trips to Los Angeles in the aftermath of a breakup, the project explores the complexities of heartbreak, drifting between moments of clarity and confusion.\n\n\u201cThere was so much love still there,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how art kind of comes from those moments.\u201d Lead single \u201cWhere She Goes\u201d emerged from a journal entry written the day after the breakup.\n\nFrom there, the EP grew into a layered and collaborative body of work. Tracks like \u201cWhen It Ends\u201d push into rock territory with biting guitars, while \u201cAnimal\u201d leans into warm, \u201970s-inspired folk textures reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac. Co-produced by Grammy-nominated Matt Rad and longtime collaborator James October, the sessions saw Ellis push himself creatively, from late-night listens to Damien Rice to recording live drums at LA\u2019s legendary Studio 606.",

At 15 years old I decided to dedicate my life to playing the guitar, writing music, touring and living the life of an artist.\n\nI owe a lot to my heroes Stevie Ray Vaughan, B.B.

    "description": "\u201cI like that the better joy sound\u2019s evolving; it\u2019s what we do as people, so it\u2019s only natural the sound grows with me\u201d says Bria Keely, better known by her stage name - better joy. A vivid indie-pop guitar project backed by a band, better joy fuses sparky melodies with strong guitars and pulsating bass lines, coated in lyrics that delve deep into all things vulnerable. The upcoming EP \u2018at dusk\u2019, a sister EP to her debut \u2018heading into blue\u2019, reflects a moment in her life \u201cwhere I just stopped trying to please anyone or caring whether the music I wrote \u2018fit\u2019 a mold. It\u2019s not on anyone else to define what better joy is: it\u2019s on me\u201d.\n\nOriginally a singer-songwriter, Bria\u2019s route into the indie guitar scene wasn\u2019t conventional: \u2018I\u2019m not one of those musicians who grew up on The Cure or played in guitar bands when I was a teenager: I was listening to pop and that\u2019s about it!\u2019. A piano player and singer from a young age, it wasn\u2019t until uni when she sang at the piano after a night out that her friends encouraged her to consider music as a career and she started writing her own music. \u201cI was pretty bad at first, but I just kept at it. And now songwriting is something I can\u2019t live without: for me, it\u2019s therapy\u201d. It was during this period that she started to fall in love with guitar bands, from Wunderhorse and Phoebe Bridgers to 80s guitar bands like The Cure and Mazzy Star, influences that have impacted the sonic development of better joy.\n\nWith her music described by BBC Radio 6 as bright, indie pop, better joy burst on the scene in 2024 with a string of singles and successful support tours; the start of 2025 saw a sell out of vinyls of her debut EP \u2018heading into blue\u2019 and a near sold out 10 city UK and EU debut headline tour in March 2025. And 2025 isn\u2019t slowing down: she\u2019s the main UK & EU support for Amy Macdonald in November and February 2026. \u201cI still can\u2019t get my head round it, to be honest. I was playing to a Glasgow audience of 100 people in March and in December I\u2019ll be playing to over 13,000 at the Hydro Arena: it\u2019s a bit bonkers\u201d.\n\nProduced by Mike Hedges (The Cure, Manic Street Preachers, U2), mixed by Caesar Edmunds (Wet Leg, Beach House) and Robbie Nelson (Rolling Stones, Gregory Porter, Beck) and recorded at Chale Abbey Studios on the Isle of Wight, the 6-track EP, \u2018at dusk\u2019 is the antidote to the previously sunny introduction to better joy, \u2018heading into blue\u2019. Where naivety and openness shone through before, \u2018at dusk\u2019 is more contemplative and vulnerable. \u201cIt\u2019s so normal to go headfirst into something, whether it be a relationship or a situation, with positivity and excitement, then for reality to leave you a bit jaded and changed\u201d she explains. Whilst the bright and jangly guitars still shine through, it\u2019s lyrics like \u2018I never showed you the heavy metal in my bones\u2019 and \u2018watch me push against the clouds\u2019 that clearly mark the tonal shift. But in true better joy fashion, the whole EP is uplifting and whilst it acts as a bookend to the debut EP, it leaves the listener hopeful for what music is coming next; the EP is \u201cclosing a chapter of my life where insecurity and self-doubt dominated my everyday experience. It\u2019s me accepting the vulnerability that I felt and kind of promising that I\u2019m gonna back myself from now on\u201d.\n\n\u2018At dusk\u2019 dances the indie-pop line with authenticity and joy, mixing dark and light tones and sounds, with a big injection of nostalgia. The first single, \u2018this part of town\u2019 is about embracing the unknown of relationships and acknowledging the fear that comes with vulnerability: \u201cEurgh, I hate being vulnerable, it\u2019s really not my bag, but then I realised it\u2019s such a universal feeling and sometimes you just have to accept it comes with being in unknown territory\u201d. \u2018steamroller\u2019 is a dark and haunting anthem for anyone who has ever been trampled on by a \u2018steamroller\u2019. Bria recalls holding it back from her live set until her team encouraged her to try it, and the first time she did, she burst into tears - something that still happens now. \u2018plugged in\u2019 is a love song, for those people who go through their life believing they\u2019re not made for love, until they meet their person and \u2018i\u2019m there\u2019 is a thank you to the person who waited for you to come home to them. \u2018big thief\u2019 is about taking back your power, before the EP finishes with the beautiful \u2018so long\u2019, a goodbye to something that could have been.",

    "description": "Big Fat Head is a byproduct of 21st century indulgence and a band consumed by sin. Based in Columbus, Ohio, this five-piece rock outfit has been categorized as \u201cpost-post-post punk\u201d and \u201cskuzz rock\u201d by fans and enemies alike. First conceived by frontman Nate Wilder during a weekend visit in jail, a consistent live band was ultimately formed with partner Olivia Stefanoff and close friends Jordan Latas, Stanic Russ, and Felicity Gunn in the aftermath of Covid. Since 2021, Big Fat Head has maintained loyalty to their homegrown tape label and oft slept-on Ohio rock scene, self-released over 40 songs, played nearly 200 shows, with over 75 out of town. While sharing a scene in the shadow of Ohio legends like Devo, Breeders, Times New Viking, etc. with bands like Golomb, Villagerrr, Winston Hightower, DANA, & countless others, Big Fat Head carved their own niche-within-a-niche and found opportunities opening for national acts such as Being Dead, TAGABOW, Sweeping Promises, Wishy, Bnny, GOON, Speedy Ortiz, Lewsberg, & more. With two finished albums in their back pocket and no outside support to date, Big Fat Head embarks to Austin, Texas looking for love with their hearts on their sleeves.",

Bijaan is a Calgary-based MC whose artistry bridges contents and cultures and has already captured the attention of major DSPs, key industry festivals, and fellow hip-hop artists and producers. Canadian born, with roots in East Africa and India, he brings a distinctly global perspective to hip-hop. Produced by the Polaris Prize-nominated hip-hop heavyweight Producer, Junia-T, \u201cJungle\u201d is a bold exploration of identity, unapologetic self-belief, and belonging, anchored by Bijaan\u2019s sharp lyricism and a unique, commanding delivery. From releasing mixtapes in high school, all the way to performing at major Canadian festivals and showcases such as NXNE, The JUNOs, Sled Island, Do It For The Culture, and Aurorapalooza, Bijaan has carved out his place as a rising voice in Canada\u2019s hip-hop scene. Blending introspection with bravado, while taking inspiration from his varied cultural roots, he stands at the forefront of a new generation of artists redefining what it means to be global in hip-hop.",

    "description": "Taking over the sweaty New York venues and curbside congregations that came to be\nsynonymous with the name, Bloodsports is set to release their long awaited debut LP Anything\nCan Be A Hammer via brand new New York label Good English Records on October 17th.\nBloodsports has become an undeniable force amidst their latest line up, where members Sam\nMurphy (guitar/vox), Jeremy Mock (Guitar), Liv Eriksen (bass/vox) and Scott Hale (drums) find\nsolace in the capitulation of sonic strain; where angular sedition blends with economical\nmelodies that lighten the load of the self-destruction that these songs embrace. But as bold as\ntheir landscapes have been prior, Anything Can Be A Hammer finds the band embracing a more\ndynamic approach, maturing in their techniques as these songs brim over with subtle fixations \u2013\nbalancing a steady pace of experimentation and curiosity that linger amongst the rhythmic blows\nand befuddling depths that the band confidently explores. Fragile, yet abundant, Bloodsports\nleans into that patience that plays to our own interior designs, where Murphy\u2019s lyricism is a\nnotion of both what we know and what we think we know, as it all comes to the fore when our\nobsessions are at large. It\u2019s an album that\u2019s got blood in its veins and a finger on the pulse.",

    "description": "Conflict is interesting in art. It forces conversations, and asks questions that often still need to be answered. On \u201cBlack\u2019s Law\u201d, the third body of work from Irish quintet Bricknasty, some of society\u2019s most complex topics are explored \u2014 religion, political disillusionment, nationalism, human mentality. For mercurial frontman/guitarist Fatboy and co, it\u2019s less about seeing the light themselves \u2014 and more pointing others in the right direction.\n\nThe winding road to releasing the nine-track project has been arduous but enriching. After forming while studying at BIMM university in Dublin, the five initial members of the band, including the aforementioned masked maverick Fatboy, production whizz Cillian McCauley and drummer Korey Thomas, released their debut EP \u201cINA CRUELER\u201d via FAMM (Jorja Smith, Maverick Sabre) in June 2023, turning heads critically and garnering a loyal fan base with its idiosyncratic style and soulful tonal core.\n\nTheir inaugural project was a stinging reflection of Fatboy\u2019s life in Ballymun, the troubled North Dublin estate where he grew up, and a vivid rumination of the familial turmoil and crippling addiction he endured during his young adulthood. But the band\u2019s follow up mixtape a year later was \u201cjust songs,\u201d the frontman says. That\u2019s even what they named it \u2014 or \u201cXONGZ \u12a0\u1235\u1240\u12eb\u121a \u1321\u1265\u201d to be precise.\n\nAlthough by no means a sub par end product, Bricknasty internally were never quite content with \u201cXONGZ\u201d; and the assembling of the mixtape proved a tumultuous time for McCauley and Fatboy\u2019s personal and professional relationship, having fallen out in the process of making its predecessor \u201cINA CRUELER\u201d. \u201c[XONGZ\u201d] wasn't really a hard thing to pull off,\u201d the latter says. \u201cMe and Cillian, we felt like we didn't give the best account of ourselves. We didn't push ourselves as hard as we should have.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to approaching this latest, third outing, the band hit the reset button. Both Fatboy and McCauley were working on music individually, but were struggling to progress beyond initial ideas. So the pair decided to escape from the drudgery of the everyday in order to gain some perspective, and booked a B&B in Ard Mhaca on the Irish border to tackle the starting foundations of the new work.\n\nThe process was reminiscent of the early days of their artistic partnership; a time prior to Bricknasty\u2019s genesis when, having stumbled upon each other on Soundcloud as teens, they\u2019d have stints making music in each other\u2019s bedrooms until the early hours. The full circle return to this familiar DIY process rejuvenated the duo\u2019s vision, and the roots of \u201cBlack\u2019s Law\u201d were born.\n\nThe entire project was made in six months \u2014 only six of those days were spent in a professional recording studio. Two of those months were spent on tour. \u201cIt was a huge amount of work that we had to get done in a tiny amount of time,\u201d Fatboy recalls. \u201cIt was a bit too much for everyone to be honest.\u201d With much to do, limited time and pressures high, the band hit a tipping point. Founding members \u2014 bassist Dara Abdurahman and keyboard/saxophonist Louis Younge bowed out of the collective, now replaced by Sam Healy and Chris LaMotte.\n\nDespite the difficult turn of events, the remaining Nasties plowed forward to finish \u201cBlack\u2019s Law\u201d, largely thanks to the symbiotic musical bond between Fatboy and McCauley. The producer holds the craft and patience to condense his frontman\u2019s volatile creativity, chiseling his bursts of genius into a digestible palette. \u201cI can spin my wheels until the cows come home,\u201d Fatboy laughs. \u201cCillian definitely is like the Quincy Jones. He finds the right spot for the right thing. I'll come in aggressive from the out go and start dancing and moving around and just trying to find stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it gets real sweaty,\u201d McCauley takes over, \u201cwhen it gets hot in the room, sometimes you just need to be able to see the take. That is the job.\u201d\n\nHis counterpart interjects: \u201cI\u2019m in the heat of the chase. I have to make mistakes. I'm obligated to shit the bed.\n\nThe testing creative process was ultimately worth its endeavour. Rip-roaringly ambitious in its song structures, \u201cBlack\u2019s Law\u201d crams vast sonic and thematic themes into sharp, groove-laden, often luscious compositions that never end as they begin. The musical variety is wide-spanning \u2014 from the house-tinged varnish of \u201cimperret illi deus \" to the wonderful Irish trad folk on \u201cis \u00e9 a locht a laghad\u201d, and a hardcore edge on the backend of \u201cgo get that blade\u201d. The EP plays out like a musical encyclopaedia, stunningly original with an almost competitive edge to its eclectic interior; a desire to \u201cput the audience in the tumble-drier and stamp on their neck,\u201d Fatboy jokes.\n\nThe frontman\u2019s lyricism is instinctively written and delivered through pained gasps and vibrato\u2019d whispers. His words put religion at the centre, the foundations of such narrative stemming from his own finding of God in the darkest of times. Stricken by drug and alcohol ad...",

    "description": "Brie Stoner is a creative code-switcher who makes music for those who've never belonged to just one place. Raised in Madrid, Spain, and now based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, she channels her multilingual life into indie dream-rock that feels both intimately personal and impossibly vast. Her upcoming LP \"Matador\" (releasing 2026) is a California-themed love letter, lush and cinematic, featuring orchestral arrangements by acclaimed arranger Kelly Pratt (St Vincent, Beck, and Beirut) and produced by David Vandervelde (Father John Misty). The album weaves strings, woodwinds, and horns through Stoner's poetic storytelling, creating an intimate portrait of artistic endurance, perseverance, motherhood, and the quiet act of creating beauty when the world feels uncertain. Her music has been featured by Ralph Lauren, Victoria's Secret, Orange is The New Black, The Affair, and Yellowjackets as well as other international TV and film campaigns. Featured in Spin, Atwood Magazine, and Magnet, Stoner's new album proves that the best art comes from moving between languages and landscapes.",

A fixture of Atlanta's legendary Northside Tavern, Buddy is a vital voice recognized for his visceral guitar work and impassioned storytelling, captivating live and digital audiences alike.\n\nSince his breakout debut at SXSW, which included a featured set at The Shade Room's activation in 2023, his momentum is undeniable. He recently performed at the James Brown Estate for the Black Music Action Coalition\u2019s Juneteenth celebration and shared the stage with Little Richard's original band at Tutti Frutti Music Festival. His new single, \"Sold His Soul,\" cemented his rise as a cinematic blues revivalist, with his cultural influence extending through partnerships with the Atlanta Hawks and BMW and a festival performance at Neon Prarie in Tulsa. Buddy Red is returning to SXSW as an essential force.",

    "description": "buffalo_farm was born from a nightmare, and forged into a dream.\n\nNight after night, he was haunted by the same nightmare. In his sleep, he found himself locked in a cage on a Buffalo Farm, forced to watch as his loved ones were brutally fed to Bison. The nightmare repeated endlessly, each time more vivid than the last. Not knowing whether his nightmares were dreams or reality, The Buffalo Farm Killer was born upon his murder of the buffalo farmer with a pitchfork, and his timely escape.\n\nThe story gives rise to buffalo_farm, a trap-metal entity that thrives in the chaos between rap and metal. His sound is raw and violent yet hypnotic, equal parts aggression and catharsis, pulling listeners into the same nightmare that birthed him. But what makes him truly unique is the contrast beneath the rage, his voice often soars in an angelic, almost ethereal way, creating a haunting beauty against the backdrop of brutality. Every track is an echo of blood-soaked visions, and every show a demonstration of the horrors he\u2019s lived.\n\nWill you join the journey of the Buffalo Farm Killer?",

    "description": "As soon as Byron Juane stepped onto the stage, you could feel his authenticity. There was no facade, no put-on persona to hide behind. Instead, there was raw honesty, a transparent openness that left no doubt in anyone's mind that this artist was the real deal.\n\nAnd that authenticity was reflected in every note, every lyric. It wasn't just about making a catchy tune or pandering to the latest trends. Byron was creating music that meant something, that spoke to the heart and soul.\n\nFrom the very beginning, he knew that he wanted his music to stand the test of time. He wanted it to be the kind of music that people would still be listening to decades from now, reminiscing about that moment when they first heard it and feeling all the same emotions rush back.\n\nAnd he's been succeeding. With every new release, he's taken his music to new heights, soaring higher and higher on the wings of his talent and passion.\n\nBut what's perhaps most remarkable is how new Byron is to the game. Despite that, his sound is like nothing else out there, a fresh take on the very soul of music that feels like it's been missing for far too long.",

    "description": "From the horror cabaret and glam-rock theatrics of his early career to the shadowy, neon-lit world of his current dark synth-pop, Austin-based performer Caleb De Casper has never stopped evolving. A classically trained pianist and vocalist, De Casper commands the stage with a sharpened, unmistakable intensity \u2014 trading in the avant-garde gowns and stilettos of the past for a bold, more masculine and unfiltered presence that puts the focus squarely on the music, the message, and the electricity of performance. His 2022 debut LP Femme Boy expanded his sonic world, weaving dancefloor heat, cinematic drama, and queer storytelling into a record that was equal parts brooding and explosive. That same year, the City of Austin proclaimed Caleb De Casper Day, recognizing his cultural impact. He went on to perform yearly at SXSW, Austin City Limits Music Festival, Utopia Fest, Houston\u2019s Art Car Festival, Thin Line Fest, and multiple Pride celebrations, while continuously advocating for LGBTQIA rights at the Texas State Capitol and beyond. Now, with his forthcoming sophomore album Delirium, De Casper enters a new creative chapter \u2014 darker, dirtier, dance-driven, and poised for a breakthrough.",

    "description": "Camille Schmidt is a Brooklyn-based songwriter who writes with the kind of emotional clarity most people spend their lives avoiding. Her songs are known for their near mythic ability to turn confession into something communal.\n\nWith her debut album Nude #9 (2025), Schmidt renders revealing portraits of herself, friends, exes (all real names used), and strangers encountered in passing: a rambling OBGYN, a woman reading breakup texts on a plane, a Reiki healer who ends a session early after claiming Schmidt\u2019s blue aura is overwhelming. Schmidt reminds us here that she is, at her core, a storyteller.\n\nSonically, Nude #9 abandons allegiance to genre. Moving beyond the folk-rooted approach of Good Person, Schmidt folds synthesizers, sequencers, and post-punk rhythms into her writing. The album appeared on multiple Best Albums of 2025 lists, with critics describing Schmidt as one of indie music\u2019s \u201cmost important rising voices.\u201d The cult-like devotion forming around her work has become a defining part of her momentum, increasingly evident in the way her songs translate from record to room. Schmidt is now at work on new music.",

    "description": "A reflection of the industrial grime and perpetual sunny glow of Los Angeles, Casket Cassette (Constant Williams) blends euphoria and melancholy in an expression of existential perseverance. Casket Cassette's depressingly danceable music takes a contemporary spin on the dark sounds of the 1980s Post-Punk and Darkwave movements, drawing further influence from New Wave, EBM, Synthpop and Indie/ Alternative to achieve this duality.\n\nThe project takes its name from a memory Williams has from childhood of his father recording a live song onto a cassette tape, then placing the tape into his grandfather's casket as it was being lowered into the ground. Williams' lyrics often reflect upon similarly somber themes such as mental health struggles, loss, heartbreak, addiction and recovery, while also offering glimmers of hope, humor and a general determination to overcome.\n\nWilliams lives in LA, and graduated in 2024 from the lowa Writers' Workshop with an MFA in poetry.",

Their stylish sonic onslaught is anchored around dancey rhythms, atypical synthesizer work, timely saxophone growls, as well as goth rock-esque melodies that serve to recount bizarre humor-laden tales from a derelict parallel universe. Since forming in 2021, the band has toured North America and Europe, sharing the stage with likes of The KVB, Bodega, Sheer Mag, Iceage, and Model/Actriz, while also taking part in events such as SXSW, Treefort Festival, Art Rock Festival, Hopscotch Festival, and M for Montreal. CDSM\u2019s introductory EP, Hell Stairs (2022), was both glamorous and bleak, swanky and derelict, uplifting and crushing, described by the band as \u201chedonism clinking in your glass, change jingling in the pit of your chest.\u201d Atlanta\u2019s hot new commodity followed with a slew of music videos \u2013 \u201cGOGO\u201d (May 11th, 2023), \u201cEntertainment\u201d (2023), \u201cDOM\u201d (2023), and \u201cSHADY\u201d (2024) \u2013 amidst a stretch that saw them bring their sweaty live set to the very best underground venues the United States, Canada and Europe have to offer.",

    "description": "Chalk is the project of award-winning musicians and filmmaker\nduo Ross Cullen and Benedict Goddard. An informed mix of\nDublin's guitar band scene and the sweaty hardcore dance\nfloors of their native Belfast, Chalk are IDLES meets Daniel Avery,\nDeath Grips meets Bicep - techno-infused industrial punk.\nSince forming in 2022, Chalk have had a rise like no other,\nquickly establishing themselves as an unmissable live act and\nunpredictable, ferocious songwriters. Their debut UK/IRE tour\nsold out, and led to further bookings across Europe as word of\ntheir performance and guitar-melded techno spread via word of\nmouth and support with national radio in the UK.\nThese songs were collated into the Conditions Trilogy, a family of\nthirteen tracks that combine gritty Irish and German-influenced\ntechno and dance music with gothic, post-punk and jagged\nguitar riffs and vocal melodies. This unique blend earned them\nthe support and kudos of their peers in Fontaines D.C., IDLES\nand Sprints, all of whom handpicked the band to support them\nthroughout their tours.",

    "description": "Chiara Savasta is a singer-songwriter from Montreal. Born in the suburbs of the city, onto a generation burdened by anxiety and desillusion, Chiara would sit in her room and romanticize her life through songwriting.\n\nThis way of escaping her teenage life became the foundation of her first project Summerhood. Released in 2022, Summerhood is Chiara\u2019s own take on the coming-of-age experience, as she herself stumbles into adulthood.\n\nHer new project, brand new girl, brand new machine, captures the universal experience of feeling too much of everything at once, in our early twenties. This new chapter reveals a more grounded and mature soul, gradually finding her footing in the world. It\u2019s through these ups and downs, always chasing the next dream, that Chiara became a brand new girl, like a brand new machine.",

    "description": "Chuck Prophet\u2019s streak of more than a dozen critically acclaimed solo records stretches all the way back to 1990, when the California native first shifted focus from his tenure with pioneering neo-psych band Green on Red to working under his own name. Since then, his songs have appeared in a slew of films and television shows, and his work has been covered by Bruce Springsteen, Solomon Burke, Heart, and a host of others. Rolling Stone dubbed him a \u201cstreetwise city kid with an eye for the country,\u201d while Uncut proclaimed him a \u201crenaissance-rocker,\u201d and NPR declared that \u201cno one can turn tales from the outer limits into catchy songs quite like Prophet does.\u201d\n\nWake The Dead, Chuck Prophet\u2019s extraordinary new album recorded with \u00bfQiensave?, dives headfirst into the world of Cumbia music. The songs are intoxicatingly rhythmic, all but demanding you move your body while you listen. There are flashes of rock and roll, punk, surf, and soul, wrapped up in the rich legacy of a genre that traces its roots back hundreds of years and thousands of miles.",

The members have performed around Austin for many years but never in such a hook-driven, song-forward capacity.

With punchy melodies and infectious hooks, congratulations deliver a mix of anthemic and experimental sounds fusing art-rock, garage, synth-pop and post-punk. The band\u2019s lyrics explore themes of modern life, love, and self-discovery, delivered with a compelling honesty and emotion. congratulations\u2019 fresh take on familiar sounds has earned them critical acclaim and a devoted and rapidly-growing fanbase, positioning them as one of the UK\u2019s most exciting up-and-coming acts.\n\nSigned to Bella Union records, with the bands debut album \"Join Hands\" due for release on February 13th.\n\nHaving gained support previously from BBC Radio 1 and BBC 6Music including a live session for 6Music for Marc Riley.

    "description": "CorMae started as a social media ad and a dream and now has evolved into an up and coming punk and riot grrrl inspired band. The band started in February 2024, and has been steadily making its way into the Austin music scene ever since. Starting with a pop-forward garage rock EP, Cutie Core, released in April of 2025 and ending last year with a bang in October 2025 with the release of their more punk-forward EP \u201cHot Damn!\u201d and an extra bonus punkified cover of Sheb Woolley\u2019s \u201cPurple People Eater,\u201d CorMae are swiftly becoming an Austin Punk mainstay. The band are nominated by the Austin Chronicle for ATX\u2019s 2025 Best Punk Band and you may also know them from opening shows for the likes of Of Montreal, Murder City Devils, and Pretty Girls Make Graves in 2025. CorMae\u2019s songs are written about life, love, social, and economic struggles and their live show is aimed at commiserating on these issues with the audience. CorMae aims to build a community of friends and fans of all ages, creeds, races, and genders. After all, who doesn\u2019t need a little cathartic shouting or a little dancing every once in a while?",

    "description": "WE MAKE MUSIC FOR DANCING, CRYING AND KISSING.\n\nCouch Dog is Maxwell Ferrer (lead vocals + guitar), Tasha Lee (bass), Pablo Acosta (lead guitar) and Liam Reece (drums). The band originally formed in San Luis Obispo, CA, and are currently based out of Los Angeles. The Dogs aim to push the boundaries of indie and garage rock with every release (whether it\u2019d be glitchy electronics, gazey ambiance or stripped-back instrumentation). Unraveler, their latest EP, is Couch Dog\u2019s most sonically diverse release to date. The project excels at retaining their classic and beloved sound from 2023\u2019s \u201cHow to Ruin Your Life Fast\u201d, distinguished by energetic guitar riffs, driving rhythms, and earnest lyricism, but elevates it with left field experimentation, song writing from different members and new textures.\n\nSince day one, they have placed an emphasis on putting on unforgettable live shows, helping audiences connect with their material deeply. Starting from sold-out house shows in their home town, to headlining a US tour, they always work on fostering a strong sense of community, belonging and freedom to go absolutely nuts in the mosh pit.",

    "description": "CQ Wrestling are a British grunge band led by best friends and songwriters Charlie Woods and Jake Mac, delivering a fierce yet melodic 90s-inspired sound. Their lyrics tackle social and political unrest while offering moments of euphoric escape, and their chaotic, high-energy shows have built a devoted following through three sold-out UK tours, Glastonbury 2025, and European festival appearances.\n\nAfter earning critical acclaim for their debut album Plus Ultra (EMI, 2023) with support from BBC Radio 1, 6 Music, and Radio X, the band are now fully independent, embracing complete creative freedom. Their first independent single, Catherine Wheels, hit the cover of Spotify\u2019s Rock List, and their upcoming release, Guns In Their Hands, is a defiant rallying cry about choice, resilience, and connection amid the chaos of the world.",

    "description": "Formed in the heart of Dallas but born on the highway, Cure for Paranoia came together during a \u201cdoomsday road trip\u201d intended to be their last. Having recently been diagnosed with bipolar paranoid schizophrenia, frontman Cameron McCloud found clarity in a hot-boxed rental car; making music with collaborators Jay Analog and Tomahawk Jonez gave him peace of mind. \u201cHe said, \u2018this is my cure for paranoia.\u2019 Instantly, everyone\u2019s eyes lit up,\u201d a pivotal realization that cemented the group\u2019s moniker. When the predicted earth-shattering meteor failed to hit, inspiration struck instead. As Jonez recalls, \u201cOn the way from Amarillo to Colorado Springs, like eight songs got written.\u201d\n\nSince then, Cure for Paranoia has shared bills with icons ranging from George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic and Nas to Ludacris and Leon Bridges. Their resume includes stops at SXSW, Fortress Festival, and the NPR Tiny Desk Contest \"On The Road\" Tour, solidifying their status as festival favorites. While keen to distance themselves from standard regional production, they cultivated a signature \"Trippy Soul infused hip hop\" sound\u2014a blend prioritized on their anchor project, the Work of A.R.T. EP.",

The band takes their inspiration from the neo-psychedelic era of the 80s and 90s (The Jesus and Mary Chain, Spacemen 3, Primal Scream) and pulls it into the future with modulating synthesizers, heavy guitars, bouncing bass lines, and spiraling hooks, creating a narcotic blend of noise and melody. DAIISTAR recorded their first studio album produced by Alex Maas of The Black Angels and engineered by James Petralli of White Denim in the summer of 2021. The band signed to UK based label Fuzz Club Records with their debut album GOOD TIME released on September 8th 2023. The album is available on vinyl including a Levitation Exclusive Edition pressing, as well as CD and digital. DAIISTAR has performed at ACL, SXSW, Levitation Austin, Levitation France, Austin Psych Fest, Barcelona Psych Fest, KEXP, KUTX and has toured with The Black Angels, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and The Dandy Warhols.",

The new collective that is Dallas Tetnus is a musical combination of all of these influences, with a stage show that is packed with static energy and a pure rock showmanship that is one to be seen.\n\nThe band plays loud, short, catchy, 70s - inspired tunes with influences from The Ramones, The Stooges, and KISS. Their unique and original stage presence is hard to forget. Their shows have plenty of visual appeal and engagement with smoke and bubbles rolling through every set, with white suits and a pink lit backdrop to boot.\n\nThe debut album, Welcome To Dallas Tetnus, is available everywhere now.",

An early encounter and collaboration with legendary Native American poet John Trudell introduced Huckfelt as friend & ally to an array of Indigenous artists & activists including Keith Secola, Louise Erdrich, Winona LaDuke, Quiltman & more. He also served as musical director and performer at \u201cWater Is Life\u201d Music + Resistance Festival in Duluth, MN and his songs appear in the new AMC TV series \u201cDark Winds\u201d produced by Robert Redford & George R.R.

Mixed vocals, hip-hop drum beats, reverb-soaked guitars, and industrial undercurrents collide to create a powerful wall of sound that is dynamic, unpredictable and deeply human.\n\nTheir debut album NOWHERE continues to gather momentum, while their second full-length record 'Some Kind Of Pure State', arriving Spring 2026, marks a bold expansion in impact and atmosphere. Festival appearances include Fuzz Club and DesertFest Berlin (2026), with recent highlights at Fusion Festival (2024), Syn\u00e4sthesie (2025) and VOID (2025).\n\nAt SXSW, The Dharma Chain bring a live show that\u2019s raw, hypnotic and built to pull you in.",

    "description": "Hi Austin! I\u2019m DJ Anupi, an Austin local with over 12 years in the music scene. My passion for DJing began in high school, driven by a desire to blend beats from the East and West and bring the best of both worlds together. Growing up listening to mostly Bollywood/South Asian music, I gravitated toward fusing global sounds with western styles. I started by creating mashups and quickly discovered my love for bringing people together and creating memories on the dance floor. What began as DJing high school dances soon evolved into spinning downtown on 6th Street, and eventually launching my own sound and events company. Through this journey, I\u2019ve DJed everything from weddings and corporate events to large-scale public parties across Texas and the U.S. Running my events company gave me the opportunity to experience music from many cultures and styles around the world, further shaping my identity as a fusion DJ. Today, my style blends global rhythms and modern beats designed to move crowds and create memories. Recently, I\u2019ve also stepped into music production, crafting remixes that I\u2019m excited to start sharing on SoundCloud.\u2028Looking forward to SXSW 2026! See you on the dance floor!",

    "description": "Unpicking the thread that stitches together Don Glori\u2019s music would be an impossible task. His records combine elements of Jazz, Funk, Soul, RnB and Samba, yet he doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any of those genres. His live show is more jazz - punk - funk than anything. One thing is certain, there is an undeniable, joyful, spirit that permeates through his music.\n\nFollowing on from the success of his 2024 album \u2018Don\u2019t Forget to Have Fun\u2019, Don Glori is back with his third offering, this time on Mr. Bongo - \u2018Paper Can\u2019t Wrap Fire\u2019.\n\u201cA kaleidoscopic genre-surfing odyssey that brings together the worlds of jazz, soul and funk. Feeling both contemporary and classic, familiar yet novel, it\u2019s an assured third release that sees an artist in full flight, showcasing their creative prowess and the uniqueness of their musical voice.\u201d",

But by now in 2025, the project has mutated into something brutal, noisy, honest, and unhinged. Motherhood, a slow unspooling of her faith, and the relentless static of American political and social climate have all pushed her toward the genesis of her own brand of dance punk - glitter grunge. So now, DOSSEY\u2019s world hinges on distortion, punk rhythm and anthemic rock vocals influenced by The Clash, Nine Inch Nails and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.",

    "description": "Dramos is a New Jersey based DJ and producer redefining Latin club music through an East Coast lens. Rooted in Puerto Rican heritage, his sound blends Latin club rhythms, house structure, and global dance energy into a modern expression of diaspora identity. His performances are immersive and rhythm-driven, built as cultural experiences that connect tradition with forward-thinking electronic production.\nWorking at the intersection of ancestral rhythm and contemporary club architecture, Dramos moves fluidly between salsa-house hybrids, Latin tech grooves, percussive house, and broader Latin club influences. Live percussion textures, melodic phrasing drawn from classic Latin music, and driving low-end foundations sit at the core of his sound, creating records and sets that feel intentional, kinetic, and emotionally charged rather than trend-driven.\nHis releases have appeared on internationally respected labels including Dim Mak, Armada, Enhanced, and Stealth Records. With a growing catalog of original productions and hybrid Salsa-House and Latin club records, Dramos is carving out a distinct lane within global dance culture that centers identity, movement, and evolution.",

After the release of their first EP in 2011, titled \"Underworld EP in Dub\", and the follow up EP \"Live in Love\" (2012), the band quickly became a staple at all Reggae events around Central Texas and established itself as a force to be recognized. Always rooted in the dub tradition, the band started to become a backing outfit for artists in the area who they felt needed a platform to perform their music. The band has backed amazing Texas, international, and Jamaican talent alike such as Likkle Shanx, Alika, Chris Boomer, Teki, Dre Z Melodi, Mister Kali, General Smiley (Michigan and Smiley), Admiral Tibet, Warrior king, Tristan Palma, Spiritual, Luciano, and so many more. Currently based in Austin, the band has re-emerged with a collection of some of Austin's finest Reggae musicians alongside original members from San Antonio. More than a band, Dub Gideon is a concept, and a force in the world of Reggae Music committed to upholding the true integrity of Roots and Culture Dub Music",

Easy Honey released their album, Cupidity Unlimited, with contributors such as Adam Lochemes (Arlie, Zach Bryan), Jon Gilbert (Mt.

    "description": "Elijah Delgado is a 23-year-old singer-songwriter from Austin, Texas, creating what he calls Indie Rock Lullabies \u2014 a blend of cinematic energy, textured guitar work, and raw emotion. Since releasing his debut EP When I Was On Cloud 9 in 2021, which surpassed 700,000 Spotify streams, Elijah has emerged as one of Austin\u2019s most compelling young voices.\n\nHe\u2019s performed on some of the city\u2019s biggest stages, including Blues On The Green 2025 for 20,000+ fans, the national anthem at Austin FC, and opening slots for Chaparelle, Next of Kin, Zach Person, and West 22nd. Festival highlights include Old Settler\u2019s, UtopiaFest, Hot Summer Nights, and ACL Radio\u2019s Drop-In, alongside headlining milestones like Meridian\u2019s first sold-out show and a packed Stubb\u2019s Indoors set following Dayglow.\n\nHis latest release, Moonboy (June 2025), showcases a bold evolution. The explosive single \u201cHide + Seek\u201d contrasts with the aching title track, \"Moonboy\", exploring isolation, hope, and transformation. With vulnerable lyrics, dynamic shifts, and soulful delivery, Elijah is building a loyal audience and cementing his place as a rising Austin artist to watch.",

    "description": "Atlanta based musician, Elijah Johnston, will release a brand new album, Stupid Soul, via Strolling Bones Records on June 20, 2025.\n\nStupid Soul is either Elijah Johnston\u2019s 4th record or his 7th, depending on who you ask, but possibly the first you\u2019ve heard. The logical next step in a career of slow burns, Stupid Soul is neither a record of morose self-reflection nor a frenetic series of genre experiments, settling into a comfortable steady pace: a record built to fit like a glove.\n\nPerformed by a small team including Johnston\u2019s brother, manager, and long-time producer, the record is full of small wonders and live band energy, the sound of four close-knit collaborators in pursuit of something timeless. 12-string acoustic guitars, vintage synthesizers, and a relentless belief in the guitar solo round out Johnston\u2019s usual pop rock palate, and the team manages to make a coherent picture out of a mood board that takes just as many cues from Brian Wilson as it does from The Legend of Zelda.\n\nElijah began his career in the legendary musical community of Athens, and he was the winner of that city\u2019s 2022 Vic Chesnutt Songwriter of the Year Award. Since then, he has toured nationally and shared stages with acts like Noah Gundersen, Susto, and Elf Power, establishing a name as a recognized songwriter with a potent live show to match.",

    "description": "EMI ANGELES is a trap artist born in Mexico City and raised in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, whose music emerges from a deep creative and spiritual duality. His name comes from the abbreviation of Jos\u00e9 Emiliano Angeles Aguado and his strong connection to the Catholic faith, a constant pillar within his identity. His project is built around two alter egos: CRVZ, which embodies madness, contained rage, and raw energy, and \u00c1ngeles, his more human, sensitive, and everyday side. Influenced by Detroit trap, hood trap, and artists such as Playboi Carti, Ye, and Abhir, EMI ANGELES delivers an authentic and daring sound designed to send chills through the body, shake emotions, and leave a lasting imprint on the listener. His first encounter with music came at an early age after discovering Michael Jackson, leading him from dance to songwriting and eventually to the microphone. Key moments such as his EP ALTER/EGO and the loss of his best friend marked a turning point in his journey, solidifying his artistic commitment. Today, EMI ANGELES transforms the unknown into experience, creating music that connects with what many are afraid to name, aiming to leave a lasting legacy within the Mexican trap scene.",

    "description": "A longtime favorite of New York City\u2019s Americana scene, Emily Frembgen returns to SXSW for her third consecutive year as an official artist at Don Giovanni Records.\n\n\u201cFentanyl,\u201d the first single off Frembgen\u2019s album No Hard Feelings released under Don Giovanni, was hailed by Glide Magazine as \u201cbrimming with sharp and twangy guitar and vocals that bring to mind the likes of Lucinda Williams, Laura Cantrell, and Amy Rigby.\u201d\n\nFrembgen spent her childhood bouncing between Colorado and Baltimore, then finally to New York City in 2000. She was shaped musically by both the grittiness of city and by Americana heroes like Kathleen Edwards and Alejandro Escovedo.\n\nIn 2021 Frembgen released her debut studio album with producer Hugh Pool at Excello Studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 2021. Irreverently titled It\u2019s Me or the Dog, it garnered widespread critical praise, with New York Music Daily naming it \u201cone of the best records of the year\u201d and Glide Magazine calling it \u201ca strong study in writing both melodies and powerful lyrics.\u201d\n\nHer next full length album, Little Stranger, is due out in 2026.",

    "description": "The music of Endearments has always turned a mirror on the inner self, reflecting life\u2019s deeply personal, often painful moments in the light of clarity and new resolve. Principal songwriter Kevin Marksson and his bandmates, guitarist Anjali Nair and drummer Will Haywood Smith, craft emotionally dense and instrumentally lush pop songs, viewed through the lens of contemporary, dreamy indie rock and embedded with a John Hughes-ian romanticism.\n\nDrawing on the emotive qualities of 80s synthpop and late-90s emo in equal measure, 'An Always Open Door', Endearments\u2019 first full-length record, fine-tunes this heartfelt songcraft, widening the band\u2019s influences and turning up the volume while maintaining the raw lyrical storytelling that\u2019s made them a mainstay in Brooklyn\u2019s highly competitive scene. The end result is a record that reevaluates the past, foregrounding emotional truths through performances that are as kinetic as they are introspective. Produced by Abe Seiferth, the album blends dreamy and down-to-earth influences into a vibrant, varied, and dynamic image of the band\u2019s inner world.\n\nAn Always Open Door will be available on March 6, 2026, via Trash Casual.",

    "description": "The Eric Hisaw Band is a roots rock\u2019n\u2019roll trio based in Austin, Tx. The 2025 Flak Records release Otra Vez draws on influences ranging from John Lee Hooker, Jerry Lee Lewis & Link Wray filtered through a 1960\u2019s Nuggets era garage rock sensibility. The bulk of the material was developed while Hisaw was laid up with a gunshot wound from a wayward bullet that entered his family\u2019s southeast Austin home. Using small Fender amps, lots of tremolo, Silvertone & telecaster guitars, Hisaw, drummer Shawn Peters and bassist Ron McRae create a rough and tumble, driving sound to support Hisaw\u2019s literate tales of outsiders living on the fringes of the American dream. Since McRae\u2019s departure to Eugene, OR, bass duties have been filled by Jimmy Pettit (of the great 80\u2019s Joe Ely Band) who has brought his own unique raw power rock\u2019n\u2019roll spirit to the band\u2019s live show. Look for lots of regional shows & new music from the band coming soon.",

Su talento como compositor escribi\u00f3 \u00e9xitos para Carin Le\u00f3n, Grupo Firme, Junior H, Tito Double P, Luis R. Conriquez y Peso Pluma, colaboraci\u00f3n que le vali\u00f3 su primer Latin GRAMMY\u00ae en 2024. Entre sus composiciones m\u00e1s reconocidas destacan \u201cVoy a Amarte\u201d, \u201cDe Fresa y de Coco\u201d, \u201cTronando Ligas\u201d, \u201cVVS\u201d y \u201cMr. International\u201d.\nescribi\u00f3 su primera canci\u00f3n a los 13 a\u00f1os, desarroll\u00f3 un estilo vers\u00e1til tras explorar g\u00e9neros como el hip-hop, la m\u00fasica reginoal. El punto de quiebre lleg\u00f3 con \u201cTriple Lavada\u201d, tema que se viraliz\u00f3 en TikTok antes de su lanzamiento oficial, super\u00f3 los 62M de streams y alcanz\u00f3 el Top 10 de Billboard con su remix. Esa\u00fa Ortiz representa la evoluci\u00f3n sonora del regional mexicano y su proyecci\u00f3n global.",

    "description": "FAMA is the musical project of brothers Facundo and Mateo, born in Peru with Argentine roots. Their name [Fa + Ma] reflects a lifelong bond shaped by music, art, and shared creative curiosity. Blending intimate acoustic pop with touches of country, funk, and organic textures. Their first-ever release surpassed 100K views on YouTube, and they continue to build momentum with a steady stream of new music.\n\nRaised on influences like Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Justin Bieber, and Shawn Mendes, both brothers bring distinct creative backgrounds (acting, fashion, and DJ culture) into a single, authentic vision. Currently working with Los Angeles-based producers including Joel Jones, Brandon Shoop, and Juan Ariza, FAMA represents the meeting point between intimacy and universality, music that feels personal, yet instantly relatable.\n\nFAMA is born from the need to feel without fear. To speak from the heart in a world that so often hides it. They don\u2019t come to be perfect, they come to be real. FAMA doesn\u2019t seek fame; it seeks connection. Every verse, every chord, every silence is an invitation to look inward and recognize yourself, always from a place of love.",

    "description": "\u2018The Family Battenberg have perfected a filthy, fuzzy psychedelic sound that they\u2019ve coined as \u201cspider\u00a0rock.\u201d (The Face)\nThe Family Battenberg's 'Anteater' single, released in April 2025, is an independent release by the Cardiff based four-piece. The track was written in just a day, and it was recorded\u00a0at Tom Rees\u2019 (Buzzard Buzzard Buzzard) studio while he was on holiday. To master the recording the\u00a0group sought out long-time collaborator Eddie Al-Shakarchi (Boy Azooga, Loathe, Swim Deep.)\n\nAligning with the soundscape that\u2019s signature to them, \u2018Anteater\u2019 is The Family Battenberg finessed.\u00a0Drenched in fuzzy saturation, spacey vocals ricochet between a blistering guitar, all while a double-tracked mono drum plays like a call to action.\u00a0 This is an anti-love song. When unhealthy adoration becomes a quest for romance, or approval in this\u00a0case, we find ourselves doing strange things. In this story, the protagonist justifies total metamorphosis in\u00a0the name of subservience. \u201cIt\u2019s self-humiliation in the pursuit of a potential suitor\u2019s attention,\u201d as frontman\u00a0Eliot puts it. Anyone that has seen this band live before is sure to recognise it from past setlists. The group had played it as an unreleased track amongst their own shows and a host of major festivals, namely,\n\nGreenman, Trans Musicales 2024, Reeperbahn 2024 and ESNS 2025. As budding upcomers, the\u00a0group have also supported the likes of Getdown Services, Panic Shack, Gruff Rhys and the Bug Club.\n\nChampioned by Steve Lamacq, Amy Lame, Huw Stephens and Adam Walton, the group are already\u00a0making their mark on the industry.\n\n'Wow I love that, a South Walian answer to Psychedelic Porn Crumpets' John Kennedy, Radio X",

    "description": "Famous Friend is the sun-bleached, indie surf solo project of ASCAP award-winning artist and producer Zachariah Carlson. Born out of the fame-soaked dreamscape of West Los Angeles, Famous Friend began as an alter-ego, a playful mirror of the city\u2019s obsession with image. His music blends washed-out indie surf guitars with sparkling dream pop production and post-punk drums, balancing joy and heartbreak in equal measure.\n\nThe result is nostalgic and cinematic: beach day euphoria melts into late night reflections about relationships past and present. Songs like \u201cTanlines\u201d and \u201cNora\u201d have earned millions of streams and support from KCRW tastemakers and helped secure him a spot as a recent member of the prestigious Taco Bell Feed the Beat class of 2025. Amidst all the noise, Famous Friend continues to turn California melancholy into shimmering, golden-hour anthems for dreamers and outsiders.\n\nP.S. The multi-instrumentalist is also a frequent writer, producer, collaborator with some of Los Angeles\u2019s premiere indie and alternative acts like Winnetka Bowling League, Casket Cassette, and Floats as well as composer for shows like the Emmy-Nominated \u201cAlexa & Katie.\u201d",

    "description": "When FEET self-released their debut album in 2019, the group offered up a particularly oblique title: What\u2019s Inside Is More Than Just Ham. But once listeners delved into the record, they found sloshing\u2019s of guitar music that careered wildly between indie, psych, and subtle shades of new wave across an exciting and unpredictable 35 minutes. Since then, FEET have seen prominent live shows have seen them supporting the likes of Inhaler and even The Rolling Stones at their huge 2022 Hyde Park shows. The bands second album \"Make It Up\" garnered further critical acclaim with the band being invited to perform a BBC 6Music Live session off the back of the single releases Greasy Boy, Why Would I Lie and The Real Thing.\n\nThe band are returning in 2026 with their third album to be released on Submarine Cat Records amidst a year of heavy touring which will see the band on two UK and European headline stints throughout the album campaign. A very welcome return, then, for one of Britain\u2019s most inventive bands, starting a new chapter afresh that builds on the brilliance of their first outing and takes it to a new level entirely. 2026, it\u2019s fair to say, is ready for Feet to stomp all over it.",

    "description": "Fine Food Market is the folk dream-pop project of Montreal-based multi-disciplinary artist Sophie Perras. Drawing from her training as a classical pianist and inspired by the sound of her beloved PSR3000 keyboard, the songs of Fine Food Market are intuitive, emotional, and fun.\n\nFine Food Market builds from the rudiments of country-folk and the experimental tendencies of the indie genre to articulate a musical place filled with sunny fields, old cars, and brightly painted houses.\n\nBoth eclectic and whimsical, the songs of Fine Food Market can also contain a real sadness, a feeling especially discoverable in her French lyrics. As a bilingual artist she unravels intimate and intricate musings in her own language, writing in a voice reserved for speaking to a close friend. Ultimately sincere, Fine Food Market may also pick up the tools of satire to describe difficult events of her own life.\n\nFine Food Market\u2019s first EP, \u201cI\u2019m afraid to be in love with someone who crashes their car So much\u201d was released in the beginning of March 2025 with Arbutus Records.",

    "description": "Formed in 2012 by Fuyuko Shioiri (Vo.Gt) and Kayo Koshimizu (Ba.Cho), the band gained attention through awards at RO69JACK and appearances at major Japanese music festivals including ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL, RISING SUN ROCK FESTIVAL, and COUNTDOWN JAPAN.\n\nThey released two mini-albums, ULTRA and JET, in 2015, followed by the full-length album PAPER in 2016. Subsequent releases included the mini-album LOVE (2017) and the album BI (2018), both charting highly on Oricon, with sold-out headline shows beginning at Shibuya Club Quattro.\n\nAfter the release of their first EP UTOPIA in 2019, Koshimizu (Ba.Cho) departed the band. In 2021, they held a sold-out tour final at Zepp DiverCity. Currently, Shioiri continues the project as the sole official member with supporting musicians.\n\nIn 2025, they released HAS, their first album in nearly four years, followed by a successful nine-city tour. Shioiri is also active as a songwriter for artists such as adieu (Moka Kamishiraishi) and Salyu.",

    "description": "The Inland Empire can either suffocate you or make you work even harder. For the past 10 years, Manuel Joseph Walker\u2019s prolific output as Foliage has helped him become a widely recognized figurehead in modern Shoegaze. A chameleonic producer, Walker draws from the broader palettes of Post-Punk while slyly incorporating textures and ideas from Hip-Hop and Electronic records, revealing ephemeral but lasting impressions that feel simultaneously intimate and ritualistic, something you can listen to in your headphones late at night or shout along with a cold lager in your hand. His song \u201cIt\u2019s Time\u201d has been featured in nearly 19K TikToks from brands such as Le Creuset, F1, & Netflix.\n\nWith his latest single \u201cMissing Hearts\u201d, featuring a music video he directed, Walker has produced his most arena-ready tune yet. With millions of streams and a reputation for unforgettable live performances, Foliage has evolved from best-kept secret to cornerstone of Indie's next generation of hitmakers. In the wake of their first full-length record in six years on the way, Foliage is poised to make a massive splash at this year\u2019s SXSW and all through 2026.",

    "description": "Future Nobodies is a genre-bending trio from Chicago, IL. Influenced by the 2000\u2019s NYC indie scene as well as 1980\u2019s post-punk and new wave, the band has developed a nostalgic, emotionally charged sound that is solely their own. Often described as \u201csad happy music to dance to,\u201d the trio croon like Morrissey over bass heavy melodies and crying guitar licks.\nThe band released their first album in 2021 (Hotel Del La Muerte) as an online project that gained immediate traction. In 2022 they released their Over it/Apasionada EP. \u201cOver It\u201d was placed on an official Spotify playlist causing the song to reach over a million streams and gain the band over 50K monthly listeners overnight. In 2023 they performed at Riot Fest. The line up included acts such as Death Cab For Cutie, Queens of the Stoneage, and The Cure. In 2024 they released their self-titled sophomore album, Future Nobodies. The album was picked up and distributed by Young & Cold Records. With the record labels help, the band made their European debut at Germany\u2019s annual Wave Gotik Treffen Festival. Since then, the band has gained underground popularity and is currently touring cities across the U.S.",

    "description": "Georgia Webster grew up in a small town in western Massachusetts, where quiet days and wide-open space gave her the freedom to write songs from a young age. With a guitar in hand and artists like Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne in her headphones, she found her voice early, and it didn\u2019t take long for others to notice. After building a devoted audience online, Georgia made the move to Nashville, where she found herself opening for artists Kelsea Ballerini & Ingrid Andress.\n\nNow stepping into her next chapter, Georgia is embracing a pop-driven sound that blends the warmth and storytelling of early 2000s pop rock\u2014pulling inspiration from artists like Sheryl Crow, Jewel, and Tori Kelly\u2014with the intimacy and emotional honesty of modern voices like Gracie Abrams and Maggie Rogers. But it\u2019s not just about the music\u2026it\u2019s about the message. Georgia is becoming a voice for the next generation of female songwriters, creating a space where people can be themselves, share the stories that make them human, and connect beyond the screen. Whether she\u2019s writing, performing, or building community in real life, her mission is clear: have fun, care deeply, and help others feel seen through creativity.",

Their debut releases were produced by Brad Shultz of Cage The Elephant and released via his label Parallel Vision in partnership with Big Loud Rock.\nTheir first offerings have earned the praise of Rolling Stone, VICE, Consequence, PAPER, NME, DORK and many others with Flaunt saying, \u201cTheir sound is fluid, and yet with each release, they evolve as a harmonious group, developing their unique sound as one.\u201d\nGirl Tones has toured with Cage The Elephant across the globe, as well as The Velveteers, hey, nothing. and Silversun Pickups in North America. Making their unignorable festival debut at Lollapalooza, Shaky Knees, Austin City Limits and more, Rolling Stone said, \u201cWhile the White Stripes \u2014 their most obvious comparison \u2014 were about controlled energy, Girl Tones are proudly imperfect.\u201d\nAs the band jumps into 2026, they have no shortage of new music and new tour dates up their sleeves.",

They've also shared the stage with bands like Phantogram, Robert Delong, Young The Giant, Urban Heat and The Unlikely Candidates along the way.\n\nTheir music has been featured on MTV, Netflix and Bravo and after releasing the fiery \"STANDING O\" in 2022 and sultry \"NEARSIGHTED\" in 2023 to both streaming success and critical acclaim the band has returned with the dark alt-pop track \"VIOLET\" and accompanying music video to finish the trilogy.\n\nIn 2025 the band was selected to become a Sonic Guild Artist, accelerating their creative output. Look for a brand new single to be released just before SXSW.",

Blending melodic sweetness with brooding dance beats, his self-described \u201cmelancholy disco\u201d sound has earned over 25 million streams and global acclaim. Since emerging with the viral 2016 EP Poptimism (whose single \u201cTry Much Harder\u201d hit No. 9 on Spotify\u2019s Global Viral Chart), Glassio has toured internationally with acts like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Nada Surf, and Electric Youth, and released two acclaimed LPs\u2014For the Very Last Time (2020, Downtown Music) and See You Shine (2022)\u2014with songs featured on Netflix and HBO. Raised between the Middle East and California and later based in New York and London, Sam draws influence from New Wave, 60s chamber pop, and early-2000s electronica, channeling it into rich, cinematic pop. His upcoming third album, The Imposter (2026), written during his move from New York to London, fuses shoegaze, folk, and dream pop in a neo-noir exploration of self-confrontation and creative rebirth. \u201cI wanted this album to make people ask if they\u2019re living the life they\u2019re meant to,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, this is about rediscovering who I am as an artist.",

    "description": "Since 1999, international punk band Gogol Bordello, led by Ukrainian frontman Eugene H\u00fctz, has been filling up rooms with an energy that could run a whole city. A lifelong lover of the punk scene growing up in Ukraine, H\u00fctz finally found himself where he felt he belonged, in New York\u2019s Lower East Side in the late 90s, where he went to shows and later performed at the legendary CBGB. Crashing at friends\u2019 apartments and playing acoustic sets in NYC Ukrainian bars, his group steadily grew to an 8 piece multicultural band, combining Eastern, Western and Latin traditions. Since then the band has lit up stages around the world alongside System of a Down, Primus, Rancid, Dropkick Murphys, dueted with Regina Spektor, and cut albums with legends Rick Rubin, Steve Albini and a forthcoming album with Nic Launay.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine is personal for Eugene & the band, who have been tirelessly advocating for Ukrainian solidarity, partnering with Nova Ukraine, ArtDopomoga, and putting together benefits with Patti Smith, The Hold Steady, Suzanne Vega, Magnetic Fields, Matisyahu and more. Additionally, they collaborated with Bernard Sumner on a cover of the Angelic Upstarts \u201cSolidarity\u201d with proceeds going to the Ukrainian Soldiers Recovery.\n\nGogol Bordello\u2019s forthcoming record, We Mean It, Man!, is due out in March 2026. For this album, H\u00fctz set out to blend post-punk textures and aggro to Gogol Bordello\u2019s free-wheeling gypsy-punk. He chose to work with the production team of Nick Launay (Gang of Four, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Idles) and Adam \u201cAtom\u201d Greenspan (Nick Cave, Idles, Flogging Molly) to accomplish this goal. Together with his long running band, they knocked out twelve super punchy and hook-laden songs. The title track, \u201cWe Mean It, Man!\u201d is all pile-driving punk intensity which crescendoes into no-wave sax skronk. \u201cNo Time For Idiots\u201d is a Strummer/Jones-esque riff-punk with a giant chorus payoff. \u201cLife Is Possible Again\u201d voices an optimism against the dread of the Ukraine war. \u201cSolidarity\u201d features New Order\u2019s Bernard Sumner on the Angelic Upstart\u2019s Solidarno\u015b\u0107-punk anthem updated to address the Ukraine war effort. This is the album and political message the world needs now.",

The music moves between aggressive and heavy instrumentation and slower, more melodic passages, creating a powerful contrast. They use their voices to create layered harmonies and the result is a unique and expansive sound.\n\nThe band have supported Idles, Big Special, Katy J Pearson and Arxx. They\u2019ve been championed by BBC Introducing and BBC Radio 1 and have had BBC 6 Music support from Steve Lamacq, Emily Pilbeam and Amy Lam\u00e9.",

Their music feels like something you stumbled into \u2014 loud enough to feel alive, honest enough to feel personal.\n\nThe Gringos aren\u2019t just a band \u2014 they\u2019re building a community. From packed college rooms to growing regional tours, their shows feel less like concerts and more like gatherings. The kind where strangers become friends, choruses get screamed back, and everyone leaves feeling like they found something.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for polished pop \u2014 look somewhere else.\nIf you\u2019re looking for your new favorite band before everyone else finds them \u2014 welcome.",

    "description": "Grocery Bag are the latest in a new breed of face-melting rock & roll straight out of Austin, Texas. The garage rock-psych-punk 4 piece, led by diminutive singer Bella Martinez, have been tearing up stages around Texas since 2023, being handpicked by the likes of Osees, Frankie & The Witch Fingers & Farmer's Wife to support on multiple shows as well as a critically-acclaimed set at Levitation Festival 2024. Following this breakthrough performance, the band were added as main support on Psychedelic Porn Crumpets tour in April/May 2025, playing 22 shows & solidifying their reputation as one of the best live bands in the country. Their debut album 'Break You' (released in Nov 2023) is a great raw snapshot of young talented musicians creating something exciting, to-the-point, that leaves you replaying time & time again. New music is expected early 2026!",

The power trio, composed of Angeeta Sentana on guitar and vocals, Akbar Rumandung on bass, and Edo Alventa on guitar, has been making waves in the Southeast Asian music scene since their formation in 2016. Grrrl Gang's music is a celebration of their collective roots and a testament to the power of pop music to connect people across cultures and borders.

With their infectious energy, socially conscious lyrics, and unique sound, Grrrl Gang is poised to take the global music scene by storm and become a voice for a new generation. Their full-length debut album, Spunky! is the sound of a band not content to rest on its laurels, despite gathering an impressive list of achievements since Grrrl Gang first got together in 2016 and proceeded to take the local, regional, and international indie scenes by storm.",

    "description": "Gus Baldwin is a singer/songwriter/ex-hippie/part-time punk from Austin, TX. After a stint holding down drums for Dallas surf punks Sealion in high school, Baldwin went on to form the Psych Pop combo Acid Carousel, which he led for 6 years and 20 something releases before departing the band. Moving to Austin, Baldwin started quickly self releasing a string of singles and EPs on his own GetWithIt! Imprint and establishing himself as the godson of Texas Rock n Roll. Teaming up with former bandmates and friends Gus formed The Sketch in 2022. Embracing the aggression of dirty punk, the looseness of garage, and the charm of power pop, The Sketch established themselves as new cornerstones of the Austin rock scene. Recording their debut LP with the group in one day of recording in LA in the spring of 2024, \u201cThe Sketch\u201d is the culmination of Baldwin\u2019s vision, manifested through the power of The Sketch themselves. In late 2025, Baldwin released his first full length solo LP. With the selt-titled debut, Gus focuses in on his rock n' roll stylings, while at the same time showing great versatility as a songwriter. Not being afraid to mix opposite loves of Punk and Pop into one cohesive album.",

    "description": "If Gus Englehorn didn\u2019t exist, one of his songs would have to invent him. A former pro snowboarder reborn as a nomadic psych-pop prophet, Englehorn has lived a rollercoaster life that reads like one of the fantastical fables that fill his songbook. Back in January 2020, right at the dawn of the pandemic, Englehorn released his first album, Death & Transfiguration [...] But even as life has since opened up again, Englehorn is still firmly situated in a world of his own madcap design. Where 2022\u2019s Dungeon Master walked the tightrope between DIY discord and prog-scaled storytelling, his third album, The Hornbook, magically transmutes the entire history of 20th-century rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2014\u201950s golden oldies, \u201860s garage spunk, \u201870s glam flamboyance,\u201880s indie transgression, \u201890s lo-fi weirdness\u2014into an alien transmission from the future. The Hornbook was mixed by Paul Leary from the legendary punk band Butthole Surfers and marked the beginning of a fruitful collaboration. Leary and Englehorn reunited on The Broken Balladeer, due February 27th 2026, this time with Leary taking on the role of producer. They also enlisted the help of industry legends Stuart Sullivan, Howie Weinberg and Kramer.",

    "description": "haha Laughing is an Austin-based experimental noise rap project consisting of long-time local musicians Jay Dilick and Aby Oviedo. The duo blends elements of hardcore rap, free-jazz, distorted electronic music and punk energy into 3 minute explosions of catchy catharsis. The chaos they curate is driven home through their live shows where Dilick and Oviedo's back and forth vocals, noise breakdowns, sample flips, and sense of playfulness create a must see live performance that is energetically engaging and delightfully disorienting. haha Laughing has released multiple EP's and singles since 2021, and released their first album \"LOSING TEETH DREAM\" in May of 2025. Their follow up EP \"BIG WHATEVER\" is set to be released Spring 2026. haha Live. haha Laugh. haha Love.",

    "description": "Hana Lili is on a mission to pursue her truth. For the Welsh artist, songwriting has always been a way to make sense of what words can\u2019t quite hold. Her self-titled EP, Hana, marks her boldest step yet \u2014 an intimate collection that distils emotion into its rawest form. Blending confessional storytelling with the dynamic spirit of 90s and early 00s alt-rock, Hana crafts\nsongs that balance vulnerability and power. Drawing inspiration from artists like Alanis Morissette, Radiohead and Gwen Stefani, she channels emotional honesty through soaring melodies and unfiltered energy. Each song feels like a conversation with herself \u2014 an exploration of identity, doubt, and the small moments that shape who we are.\nHana\u2019s music merges introspection with rebellion, turning personal chaos into connection. Raised in Wales and a first-language Welsh speaker, Hana\u2019s sense of place runs deep. Her roots in the Welsh Eisteddfod tradition \u2014 a celebration of language, music, and storytelling \u2014 instilled in her a lasting belief in the power of creative expression.\nWith a sound that bridges intimacy and universality, Hana Lili stands as one of alt-pop\u2019s most distinct and fearless emerging voices.",

    "description": "Searching. Playfulness. Rediscovery of the once known. These thoughts permeate through Hanorah\u2019s creative impulse. The multidisciplinary Canadian artist, chiefly known for her\npowerful emotive voice, transforms the old into the new as she charts waters at once familiar and unknown. Weaving influences from RnB, rock, and shoegaze, she\u2019s ready to redefine what soul music can be, exploring new sonic landscapes as she creates something both fresh and timeless.\n\nHer new EP, Closer Than Hell, is a collection born from that very tension\u2014between desire and uncertainty, between the things you don\u2019t know and the parts of yourself you\u2019re afraid to face. The theme of searching threads through each song, a quiet but persistent pull toward something elusive, something just out of reach. You hear it in the aching vulnerability of her lyrics, the way her voice rises and falls as if chasing after a feeling that might only exist for a fleeting second, before slipping away. But there\u2019s play in it too. Her EP is about the delicate, messy dance between letting go and holding on\u2014about being lost but also willing to find the joy in the search.",

Hector Gannet have been praised by music lovers from Chris Packham to Sam Fender, while Uncut magazine acclaimed the band as \u201cNorth Shields\u2019 answer to Crazy Horse\u201d. There have been live dates with artists from Elbow, Sea Power to Lindisfarne, Richard Thompson & Kathryn Williams \u2013 & massive shows with Sam Fender at the vast North Eastern shrine that is St James\u2019 Park football ground. Hector Gannet have drawn pleasing reactions. On BBC 6 Music, musician and broadcaster Tom Robinson greeted a \u201cband of exceptional talent\u201d. In a **** review, MOJO magazine saluted the \u201cpointedly political, natural-world-advocating folk rock\u201d of their The Land Belongs To Us album. Louder Than War website put Hector Gannet among 25 bands to change your life. Forthcoming album includes rousing soul sermons which blend their North Eastern heart with touches of Dexy\u2019s, Style Council-period Weller and a bit of the Boss",

    "description": "Henry Flower is the cult rock alter-ego created by David Van Witt, who derives great inspiration from his peculiar upbringing. Born in Belgium and raised in a meditation community in Iowa, Van Witt spent his childhood moving around the US with his single, clairvoyant mother who remembers her own birth. Flower and his musical collective and live band dubbed The Infinite Void interpret these childhood memories through a spiritual, dreamlike lens for their debut album, VISIONS OF THE DAYTIME MOON (October, 2023).\n\nDuring the album\u2019s six-year writing process, Flower incorporated meditation, drone music, hypnosis, improvisation, and other eclectic techniques to produce an indie rock record that is as imaginative as it is classic. In the album, Flower ponders the mysteries of life in poetic croons over a bed of psychedelic flutes, soulful piano, 70s guitars, bouncing congas, gospel choirs, new age beats, and innovative production.\n\nWith his seven-piece live band, The Infinite Void, Henry Flower proselytizes his imagined religion, praising the infinite void and building a cult-like following with electric, church-like live performances.\n\nHenry Flower and his band are an iconic NYC entity, gathering over 30 players on their roster throughout their six-year album process. Musicians on their upcoming album and seven preceding singles include co-producer Sam Cohen (Kevin Morby, Dangermouse, Sharon Van Etten), Melanie Chambers (Oracle Sisters, Widowspeak, Lovetempo), Mattie Safer (The Rapture, Poolside), Abdon Valdez III (Cornelia Murr), Rosie Slater (Darlene Love, Delicate Steve), and saxophonist/flutist Walter Fancourt (Yeasayer, Super Yamba Band).",

    "description": "Home Counties return with their second album 'Humdrum', a sharp, dance-driven evolution produced by Al Doyle of LCD Soundsystem and Hot Chip. Trading guitars for restless grooves and twitchy synths, the band dissect the chaos of modern life with wit and precision. Dual vocalists Will Harrison and Lois Kelly explore jealousy, self-doubt and overthinking across ten hook-laden tracks that balance melancholy and euphoria. Already acclaimed for their electrifying live shows, Humdrum cements Home Counties as one of the UK\u2019s most inventive new bands.",

    "description": "Honey I'm Home is an Amsterdam-based shoegaze outfit that powerfully captures the raw energy of '90s alternative rock and blends it with a fresh, modern sound. Inspired by bands like My Bloody Valentine, Smashing Pumpkins, and DIIV, they've created their own unique take on the shoegaze, indie, and emo genres. On stage, Honey I'm Home unleashes their full power: captivating live shows that balance between fragile intimacy and explosive outbursts carried by layered guitars and deeply felt lyrics.\n\nRecently named #1 emerging act at Europe\u2019s leading new-music showcase festival (ESNS), a list with a strong track record of identifying artists before their breakthrough. \u201cHoney I'm Home is reaping the benefits of the shoegaze revival. But it's not just timing, they are really great. The packed room gets their faces melted off, but sometimes gets a breather in the shape of a beautiful verse. The unexpected breaks, original melodies and smart tempo changes give the set its own, authentic sound.\u201d\n\nThe band supported Hotline TNT, Goat Girl and the Crawlers on shows throughout the EU and UK, and played key European showcase festivals including ESNS, Reeperbahn Festival and Left of the Dial.",

    "description": "Hot Garbage melt into a heavily volatile yet undeniably palatable amalgamation of sonic elements. Calling on the driving rhythms of dark post-punk and motorik krautrock, the Toronto-based outfit seamlessly works shining melodies and swirling textures into deliberate, brooding arrangements. Since forming in 2015, the four-piece have toured extensively throughout Canada, the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom, bringing their intense live sets to festivals such as Levitation, Freakout Fest, Treefort, SXSW, Sled Island, FME, M for Montreal and Pop Montreal, and sharing the stage with notable acts such as Osees, Ty Segall, L.A. Witch, Frankie and the Witch Fingers, JJUUJJUU, Mdou Moctar, Wand and Kikagaku Moyo. The quartet recently returned with Precious Dream (January 19, 2024 via Mothland & Exag\u2019 Records), a sprawling collection of songs written in isolation and brought together alongside visionary producer Graham Walsh (METZ, Preoccupations, Holy Fuck, !!!), offering an exhilarating new breath into the world of post-punk and modern psychedelia, a listening experience that is equally cathartic and introspective.",

    "description": "We are a Mexican lead British 3-piece alternative post-grunge rock band. Starting in early 2022, our lead singer moved from Mexico to the UK. The band formed after an impromptu rehearsal session and discovering the chemistry we had playing together we quickly got to work. Writing, playing gigs and recording, releasing our first single in that same year, shortly followed by our debut EP Lonesome Joy. We are now about to release our debut Album with the first few singles already out and their music videos on YouTube hitting almost half a million views.\nHailing from Mexico, Giselle brought to the UK her unique taste and a talent for writing folk pop, looking to explore a new musical direction fuelled by a passion for rock. Finding Cameron and Charlie, two British born and raised musicians marked the inception of I See Orange, mixing multiple genres into their unique post-grunge sound, a deliberate combo of captivating melodies, clever lyricism and heavy rock.\nBringing raw energy, heavy riffs and powerful melodic vocals to every stage we hit. We blend the gritty, nostalgic sound of the 90's with our own unique twist.",

    "description": "I-SKY, West Malaysian based Producer-DJ - inspired by the likes\nof Skrillex, Baauer, TNGHT and Boys Noize; started with shows that always promised a\ntailored selection expanding from his favourite local/regional products to carefully curated underground dance finds from his internet digs, he since has established himself as a household name in the 2010s KL nightlife scene.\n\nWhile DJ-ing has always been a conduit for his artistry, I-SKY delivers his crafted studio-to-stage experience best as both an artist and passionate producer. Known for his fresh-to-death remixes, I-SKY originals ride along the same wavelength too through his constant redefinitions of electronic dance.\nThough the name doesn't have any literal meaning, the autodidactic disciplinary defines his namesake with, \"I just needed\nto find a catchy name... to find something that rhymes with my first initial, hence, the I... and SKY. Over the years, I guess the name gave meaning to itself. There's a saying: the sky is the limit. I've always hated being stuck in a box. I like to let my creativity run wild. To be free to experiment & dabble in different sounds & styles. So, l am the limit to what I can and wanna do.\"",

With family ties to Quiroga, Michoac\u00e1n, Jim\u00e9nez, Chihuahua, and Huehuetl\u00e1n el Chico, Puebla, their songs carry the weight of two cultures, three journeys, and one voice that speaks from the heart.\n\nThey grew up listening to everything \u2014 from the romantic ballads their parents played at family gatherings to the raw, emotional sounds of corridos tumbados and alternative rock. That blend of influence shows up in their music, where traditional meets modern, and every lyric is grounded in real feeling. For Fernando, Jes\u00fas, and Carlos Ilusi\u00f3n is more than a name \u2014 it\u2019s a reflection of their dreams, struggles, and everything they\u2019ve felt along the way. Their sound isn\u2019t boxed into one genre because they don\u2019t live in just one world.",

    "description": "Isak Thomas and The Stoop Boys is a soul/funk collective of artists primarily based out of Austin, Texas, and Nashville. Originally founded in Boston, MA, by Isak \u201cThomas\u201d Kotecki (keyboard/guitar/vocals) in 2017, Isak began collaborating with close friends from music school, Connor Frawley (bass/vocals) and John Cattini (lead guitar/vocals), with a shared love of \u201970s soul, funk, and rock music.\nWhen the three eventually moved their separate ways across the country, they continued to convene once a year for a week of writing and recording. This tradition has stayed true through three EPs and two albums, garnering millions of streams and features such as KUTX\u2019s Song of the Day.\nThe group has a unique take on its writing process, with every member serving as a rotating writer and vocalist, centered around native Austinite Isak Kotecki as producer. In the latest full album release, 'The Stoop Boys', the group saw the addition of Armando Baeza (drums/vocals) and Logan \u201cWildman\u201d Garza (vocals/percussion), also joining as writers.\nThe Stoop Boys aim to bring music that feels like yesterday, hits like today, and sticks with you tomorrow.",

    "description": "At just 24, Jamie Duffy has emerged as one of Ireland\u2019s most compelling new artists, blending folk, classical, and contemporary influences into a sound that\u2019s both intimate and cinematic. His debut single Solas became the most streamed debut by an Irish artist since Hozier\u2019s Take Me To Church, with over 135+ million streams on Spotify, 27 million YouTube views, and 7.3 billion views on TikTok.\n\nIn 2024, he released his debut EP On A Wing, sold out his first Irish headline tour (2,600+ tickets), and supported Andrea Bocelli and Hans Zimmer at BST Hyde Park.\n\nIn October 2025, he released his highly anticipated debut album Jamie Duffy. Crafted over two years between wild coastlines and still nights across the two awe-inspiring landscapes of Ireland and Iceland, the album reflects Jamie\u2019s rural Monaghan roots, shaped by changing environments, Irish folklore, love, light and trepidation. It is a true labour of love and effort rarely known by those in their early twenties, but for Jamie, it was a journey he\u2019s been working towards for some time. While evident themes of nature, journey, light and hope spring forward from early listens, the messages within the album, will hopefully, be different for everyone.\n\nAlongside the album, Jamie has scored his first feature film 500 Miles, (starring Bill Nighy and Maisie Williams) due to be released in 2026. Reuniting with his album producer Atli \u00d6rvarsson at his home studio in London, the project highlights the creative strength and synergy between the two collaborators.\n\nWith over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify and sold out dates across Ireland, UK and Europe, Jamie is cementing his status as a formidable and rapidly rising global artist whose music continues to resonate with a massive and expanding international audience.",

    "description": "JOPLYN is a Berlin-based electronic live act moving between melodic house, techno, and electronica, guided by a distinct voice - both literal and emotional. Writing, producing, and performing exclusively original material, her live shows unfold as immersive experiences where vocals, synths, and improvisation meet intuition and intensity.\nHer music has traveled widely through collaborations with artists such as Booka Shade, R\u00f6yksopp, Robyn, Damian Lazarus, MK, and Jan Blomqvist, with releases on labels including Defected, Get Physical, Diynamic, Crosstown Rebels, Mobilee, and Watergate Records. In 2022, Pete Tong named her BBC Radio 1\u2019s Future Star.\nBeyond the club, JOPLYN\u2019s work reflects a growing curiosity for depth, vulnerability, and transformation. After more than 150 shows worldwide, including Ibiza residencies at H\u00ef Ibiza and WooMoon/Cova Santa and a debut at Coachella\u2019s Yuma Tent, she is opening a new chapter. She is currently working on her fourth studio album, set for release in 2026 on her own label None Of The Above (N.O.T.A.) Berlin, exploring a more expansive and emotionally resonant sound.",

    "description": "\"Pain is a fine knife sharpened by love.\" So says Joudy frontman Diego Ramirez when reflecting on the NYC group's latest endeavors. This emotional clarity and exposed honesty is a hallmark of the band's most vital, intense era yet. Set aside are the evocative lyrics and lush soundscapes of their earlier releases. In their place, lyrical and sonic directness is embraced on the unvarnished and love-torn upcoming album Permanent Maintenance (out DATE on Trash Casual). This is a record that distills Joudy's soaring rock into something simply shorter, louder, and stronger.\n\nFor the trio, rounded out by fellow Venezuelan emigres Hulrich Navas (drums) and Carlos Rey (bass), this streamlining is just another natural step forward as they uncompromisingly blaze a trail amongst life's shadowy moments.\n\nJoudy have always tried to make sense of \"this messy universe\". While the wide angle lens fantasies of recent albums, Obertura and Destroy All Monsters, sought to do that through grand expositions, Permanent Maintenance brings it down to the most acute of human experiences: to love and to lose. While these are deeply personal songs, they are universal.",

    "description": "Joyeria (pronounced Joy-ah-ree-ah) is a London-based outfit led by a Canadian-Polish songwriter who famously spent years quitting bands at their peak to keep his creative soul intact. Now a staple of London's underground scene, the group is a vehicle for \"working in the dark\"\u2014a shape-shifting project that prizes sincerity over polish.\n\nMusically, Joyeria delivers a darkly comic blend of slacker indie and experimental post-punk. Fronted by a deadpan baritone, the songs tackle the absurdity of modern adulthood, capitalism, and workday fatigue with biting, sardonic wit. Their EPs, FIM and Graceful Degradation, were produced by Dan Carey, captured raw and live-to-tape to preserve the \"chaos\" of the moment rather than a rehearsed demo.\n\nWhile born from a singular vision, Joyeria is a formidable four-piece band. Known for being \"purposely under-rehearsed,\" the ensemble thrives on improvisation, ensuring no two sets are the same. With a stage presence that balances Ian Curtis\u2019s intensity with Stephen Malkmus\u2019s irony, the band utilizes an unpredictable, dissonant energy to create a sound that is as imposing as it is eccentric.",

Her work lives at the coalescence of laugh-out-loud humor and acute melancholia, and it\u2019s a rare show that doesn\u2019t elicit tears from someone in the crowd.\n\nPraised by Pitchfork for her \u201csmooth country alto\u201d, Under the Radar described her sound as an exploration of the \u201cbroader world of chamber pop, soul, and gentle salves of singer/songwriter intimacy.\u201d Graham Hunt has called her a modern-day Carole King. Some people look effortless on stage; Blair somehow pulls off the opposite trick. She doesn\u2019t traffic in effortlessness\u2013 she performs with full-body earnestness that sings from the crown of her head down through her toes.\n\nHer new album, All of My Important Things, is out November 7 on Don Giovanni Records, examines our relationship to material possessions through the lenses of childhood memory, a secondhand blanket, and the enduring notion that a lifetime of accumulated shit can never match the wonder of the first little treasures we held as kids.",

Now, she\u2019s rolling out a five-song project leading up to a full EP drop in time for AmericanaFest in September. The lead single, \u201cLove Me When I\u2019m Leaving,\u201d sets the tone for a collection of songs that explore the beauty and heartbreak of moving on.\n\nWhether playing an intimate acoustic set or leading a full band, Julie delivers music that\u2019s as honest as it is powerful.\n\nLittle bit moody, little bit soulful country, a little in your face, unapologetic, bold.",

    "description": "\"Bruce Springsteen + Cocteau Twins = Junerise\" - KUTX\n\nJunerise is the heartland dream pop project of Austin-based, Utah-transplant singer-songwriter June Bennion, (They/Them).\n\nLooking ever skyward, June channels influences from the grounding story-centric songwriting chops of James Taylor and Bruce Springsteen to the ethereal gradient-scapes of The Cocteau Twins and Brian Eno with a dash of The Cure's dance-forward sensibilities. Their songwriting comes from a well of lived experiences growing up as a closeted queer person in the god-fearing Mormon mountain states.\n\nJune tackles feelings of isolation, wonder, and perseverance against the odds set against a sunset sky, quickly fading out of view as each song flows from scene to scene as each story is told. Junerise is a long incubated project which at times is downright danceable while also reveling in the beautiful transience of each passing moment.",

    "description": "The experimental art-rock collab of multi-instrumentalist creators Sam Maloney and Desiree Das Gupta, Kali Horse blends fantasy and harsh realism, colliding genres with reckless abandon. Production that dips between the best of alt-rock and avante-pop spheres, Kali Horse is a celebration of intentional genrelessness. Digital and live drums under emotional harmonies, swimming guitar enveloped by foley samples make the live band ripple with eccentricity. Their avante-pop whimsicality channels Bj\u00f6rk, their soaring anthemic moments reflect their rock roots. The combo of Sam's feathery vocal and Des' powerhouse belt has their voices in conversation with one another - a hypnotic connection. The debut record 'Some Type of Electric Lagoon' (2023) is a vibrant metaphorical swamp journey, an opus. The new EP '2099' veers into industrial soundscapes - a bold snap back to reality. More bite and grit, with a higher polish than ever thanks to Emmy-winning foley artist Brandon Bak (Possum, OOZ). The live act lit up festivals like NYC\u2019s New Colossus and Ontario's River & Sky, opening for and somehow making sense with SUUNS and Ruby Waters alike. Hypnotic. Psychedelic electronic. artrockbeats.",

    "description": "Karma Sheen is a London-based project led by British-Pakistani artist Sameer Khan, fusing the spirit of psychedelic rock with the emotional depth of Hindustani Classical music. Born from the tension between tradition and distortion, the project reimagines raag-based forms through fuzz pedals, improvisation and diasporic imagination.\nRooted in Khan\u2019s training under Ustaad Latafat Ali Khan (Sham Chaurasi Gharana), Karma Sheen translates classical ornamentation into immersive soundscapes. Khan is joined by guitarist Amad Chima, sitarist Rodrigo Bourganos, bassist and visual artist Grisha Grebbenikov, and drummer/DJ Arun Dhanjal, forming a collaboration that bridges ancient lineage with contemporary subculture.\nThe band released their debut album in 2023, followed by extensive UK and European touring, including sold-out headline shows at Rich Mix and the 100 Club, and festival appearances at Shambala and Trans Musicales, where they recorded a KEXP live session due for release in early 2026.\nNow working with EBB Music, Karma Sheen are building international momentum as they prepare to release their second album in 2026.",

    "description": "Born in 2001, Philadelphia ignited its very own genre-bending firecracker: Kayanne Peppa. Also known as \u201cBunnii,\u201d Kayanne began her creative journey at a young age, exploring various arts, writing, orchestra, & musical theater. Her curiosity later expanded into cosplay/design, & music laying the foundation for the bold world she creates today. Inspired by her brother, she began recording her own raps on GarageBand in high school, transforming a playful hobby into something more. Her music now emerges from the depths of fearless self-expression, blending hip-hop grit, punk rebellion & an unmistakable sense of play. With her animated and striking stage confidence, Kayanne Peppa turns every performance into an experience. Being instantly recognizable for her bunny ears, each show she lovingly gives them out to honor the memory of her beloved bunny, Kirby.Drawing inspiration from artists like Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Michael Jackson, Avril Lavigne, Gwen Stefani to name a few, she refused to stay in one lane. To her life is one big anime, where exaggeration, bold looks, and unapologetic individuality are quite essential.Kayanne Peppa\u2019s music is made for main characters only!",

    "description": "Kety Fusco is electro-acoustic harpist, composer, and producer who has redefined the harp for the contemporary stage. Armed with her 47-microphone electro-acoustic harp, distortion pedals, and electronics, she transforms the instrument into a visceral voice that screams, whispers, and resonates far beyond classical tradition.\nHer debut album The Harp was selected by Iggy Pop as \u201cbest album\u201d on BBC Radio 6, and in 2025 she will release BOH\u00c8ME (A Tree in a Field Records), featuring a collaboration with Iggy Pop. Fusco has toured extensively across Europe and Latin America, performing at prestigious venues such as the Royal Albert Hall, Montreux Jazz Festival, and Mexico\u2019s CENART, and as a Swiss cultural ambassador at the Euro Jazz Festival (Mexico City) and South America tour for Swiss Embassies.\nIn 2025, she has also been invited by the U.S. Department of State to participate in the prestigious International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), recognizing her as an ambassador of Swiss music and cultural innovation.\nHer work bridges classical training and radical experimentation, from reimagining Beethoven\u2019s \u201cF\u00fcr Elise\u201d as a furious electronic cry to composing soundtracks for film and RAI Radio3. With over 200 live shows in three years, Kety Fusco is carving an unprecedented path for the harp in electronic music.",

    "description": "Kids is an art punk project focused on writing the most subversive music possible within tight limitations. Their sound is characterized by a lack of effects pedals, idiosyncratic arrangements and song forms, and an irreverent high energy that contrasts with their relatively minimal sound. The crown jewel of Kids is in the double vocals: All of their music relies on meticulous interplay between Venezuelan guitarist Julio Prato and bass player Ani Kramer on the vocal front, reimagining the idea of a song as more of a conversation between lead vocalists rather than the highlight of just one. All this is laid atop a flurry of cutting edge guitar work, grounding bass lines, and the one-of-a-kind surgical manner of drumming Colin Ferguson always brings to the table.\n\nTheir debut full length album REPETITIOM VARIATIOM released in the summer of 2024 is their most ambitious release to date, relying on disorientation, indulgently varying repetition, evocative imagery, and their signature sound palette to conceive music that feels familiar, humorous and encouraging, yet pronouncedly uncanny.",

Each track is a vignette of life, steeped in nostalgia, resilience and a yearning to belong. It\u2019s music that\u2019s as much about catharsis as it is about connection.\n\nFirst single \u2018Transgressions\u2019 is a confessional anthem. Nostalgia and identity are painted vividly in the second single as the band retrace childhood, its warmth underpinning an unflinching honesty.\n\nYet it\u2019s the title track which lies at the emotional heart of this debut. Empathy is portrayed as both gift and curse, a force that connects deeply to others\u2019 pain, yet at times threatens to overwhelm.\n\nIt\u2019s a debut album that\u2019s as unguarded and unflinching as the band themselves, sure to resonate with anyone whose heart has ever felt too full.",

His breakout single \u201cDeepika\u201d \u2014 a cheeky love letter to Bollywood icon Deepika Padukone \u2014 earned co-signs from SZA, Isaiah Rashad, Zane Lowe, and the actress herself. He followed with \u201cdirty,\u201d a sharp satire on cultural fetishization that amassed over 25M views and marked his directorial debut. Now signed to 10K Projects, KOAD is also the co-founder of KOGO, an artist community home to prolific originals including Asha Imuno, Curtis Waters, REHMA, CONNIE, Nafeesisboujee & more.

    "description": "KOJ is the sound of defiance rising from Liverpool, UK: a working-class voice turned outward, loud enough to cut through the noise, resilient enough to remain unshaken, and connected enough to represent a frustrated generation.\n\nDrawing from the raw British sub-cultural sounds of Grime, Rap and Punk, KOJ creates music that confronts power while rooted in relatability and everyday struggle. Revolutionary in spirit yet populist in appeal, his music is built to connect, move, and be felt collectively. At its core is courage - raw, direct lyricism exploring survival and defiance, darkness and light, pressure and pride.\n\nKOJ showcased his lyrical authority on his acclaimed debut EP Villain With A Conscience, earning support from Clash, Wonderland, The Face, Apple Music and Amazon Music.\nLive is where KOJ reaches another level. He doesn\u2019t perform - he leads. From Boomtown to Radio 1 Big Weekend, Reeperbahn and SXSW, his shows become charged, communal moments where tension turns to release.\n\nMore than a catalogue, KOJ is building a movement through purpose-driven visuals, tech-led collaborations and his growing TRiBE community \u2014 \u201ca man on a mission,\u201d as The F-Word Magazine puts it.",

At 17, with just a laptop and guitar, he began recording music inspired by Spanish alternative rock and post-punk influences. He debuted with Nunca He Sabido Amar, and in 2023 released his first EP, Morro, featuring Un D\u00eda Como Hoy, now with over 6.5 million streams. In 2025, La Texana released his first full-length album, signed by the spanish label Sonido Muchacho \"La Casa Que Cae\", a 10-track record exploring identity and new beginnings, reaching over 8 million streams. It includes standout tracks like Terco, El Sol, and Dispara. In May, he performed a sold-out debut at Lunario of Auditorio Nacional and is now touring across Mexico (40+ cities) and 7 countries, with more dates to come. La Texana is currently preparing for his biggest show yet at Teatro Metrop\u00f3litan in February 2026. His style continues to evolve, blending vulnerability and nostalgia, while connecting with a new generation of Mexican musicians and growing an international audience.",

    "description": "Lee Vasi is an Atlanta-based R&B artist originally from Fayetteville, North Carolina. Raised singing with her siblings and performing in theater, her Puerto Rican-Dominican and African American heritage shaped her diverse musical influences and passion for honest storytelling. She wrote her first song at age 10 while backstage at The Lion King on Broadway, where she performed as Young Nala, and later appeared on American Idol.\n\nAfter taking time to reconnect with her faith and artistic direction, Lee returned in 2023 with her single \u201cMy Bad,\u201d which gained traction following a bilingual a cappella performance on Kai Cenat and Speed\u2019s livestream. In early 2024, her breakout single \u201cTeach Me\u201d went viral on Instagram and TikTok ahead of release, earning her first Billboard chart entries, including #2 on Gospel Digital Song Sales and #21 on Hot Gospel Songs.",

Influenced by artists like Tinashe, KAI of EXO, and Omar Apollo, his work blends polished performance instincts with a cinematic visual sensibility and modern production choices. His recent EP, Garden of Sol, is focused on themes of nostalgia, temptation, and solitude, expressed through bright pop and R&B sonics and sun-rich visuals that draw from early-2000s pop language without feeling like a throwback. A Recording Academy member, Leo Von Sol balances candid, behind-the-scenes authenticity with a professionally branded presence, while his style sits at the intersection of luxury streetwear and high fashion, always intentional, elevated, and lived-in.",

Her sound blends rap, afrobeats, pop, and Afro-diasporic influences into an energetic, dance-driven experience.\n\nWith a magnetic presence and distinctive songwriting, LEOA moves between Portuguese, English, Spanish, and French, weaving bridges between cultures and identities.

    "description": "One of France\u2019s most distinctive a cappella acts, Les Itin\u00e9rantes turn three voices into an immersive, ritual-like live experience.\n\nLes Itin\u00e9rantes (french for \"The Wanderers\") are one of France\u2019s most acclaimed a cappella trios, recognized for transforming vocal performance into a powerful live experience. Founded in Paris in 2017, the group was born from a chance encounter and a shared desire to explore the voice beyond established genres.\n\nWithout instruments, they approach singing as a living, embodied material - a space of memory, transmission, and human connection. Their repertoire spans over nine centuries of music and more than fifty languages, blending ancient and traditional songs with original compositions. This diversity is not encyclopedic, but intentional: a search for what unites people across time, cultures, and borders.\n\nPraised by the French press for the ritual, purity, and emotional depth of their performances, Les Itin\u00e9rantes are known for rare vocal precision and a strong sense of presence. Their concerts are intimate and immersive, offering audiences a focused, shared experience of listening.",

    "description": "Lew Apollo is a rising force in modern soul, captivating audiences with his soul-stirring melodies and poignant songwriting. KUTX praised him as \u201cthe perfect summer vibe,\u201d a fitting description for an artist whose music blends hypnotic guitar, cinematic production, and a sultry, smoky voice into lush, resonant soundscapes. Originally hailing from rural Barnum, MN, Lew\u2019s artistry is deeply rooted in his home state\u2019s heritage, fusing the legacies of Bob Dylan and Prince with modern influences like Hozier, Leon Bridges, and Labrinth.\nThe tragic loss of his father in 2022 profoundly shaped Lew\u2019s songwriting, catalyzing a body of work that confronts themes of grief, isolation, and resilience while offering hope and connection. His debut EP JUNGLE, produced by BLK ODYSSY, introduced him as a bold new voice and fueled a run of sold-out shows at iconic Austin venues like The Pershing and Antone\u2019s.\nSince then, Lew has taken his music to wider audiences, touring in support of Los Lonely Boys and earning airplay on KUTX with his single \u201cDiamonds and Gold\u201d as well as \u201cLet the Light In\u201d from his debut album. Self-produced from start to finish, Fool\u2019s Gold has already surpassed 300,000 streams in under two months and is creating buzz for its fearless vulnerability and lush production. Press outlets have echoed the excitement: AMP Music declared \u201cLew Apollo will be a force in the R&B and pop stratospheres. Be warned,\u201d while Earmilk praised how \u201cApollo\u2019s signature smoky voice sets the tone for a sultry soundscape.\u201d With his clear vision and unwavering dedication to using music as a vessel for healing, Lew Apollo is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting new voices to watch in soul.",

They\u2019ve earned acclaim from tastemakers including Tone Deaf, Frankie Magazine, Pilerats and Music Feeds, secured airplay across triple j, Double j, triple j Unearthed and community radio. The group were also showcasing artists at Bigsound 2024.\n\n2025 saw Little Guilt release two singles and join UK artist Freak Slug as the main support on their Australian national tour. The five-piece has kicked off this year supporting Nil\u00fcfer Yanya and showcasing at SXSW Austin. You can expect to hear new music from Little Guilt with their new 6-track EP releasing mid-2026.\n\nWith a subtle air of formidable cool and songs to sink your teeth into, it seems a little guilt goes a long way.",

    "description": "Little Wilderness is a dynamic, homegrown rock band that draws inspiration from the rugged landscape of Southwest Colorado, blending the raw energy of rock 'n roll with the unique environmental influences of the Four Corners region. Formed in 2011, the band has become a key player in Durango's music scene, with a lineup that includes Paul Henderson (guitar/singer), Dan Szabo (lead guitar), Juan Lopez (bass), and David Sachs (drums).\n\nTheir debut album, Big Tent (2019), released on Flak Records out of Austin, Texas, encapsulates their diverse sound. The album's opening track, \u201cCrazy World,\u201d is a high-octane composition that sets the tone with its fiery guitar riffs and driving rhythm. Other songs, like \u201cNarrow Gauge,\u201d incorporate elements of country and Americana, while tracks like \u201cLaid Low\u201d and \u201cStarting New\u201d showcase their indie rock sensibilities. The band\u2019s style evokes the spirit of an era when garage bands ruled the airwaves, characterized by loud amps and hard-hitting drums.\nWith their blend of gritty rock 'n roll and Southwestern flavor, Little Wilderness proves that the genre is alive and well, and they\u2019re here to keep it that way.",

Her debut EP Come of Age captures the messy in-between of growing up. Heartbreak, family tension, and the pressure of figuring out who you\u2019re supposed to be versus who you actually are.\n\nInspired by icons like Stevie Nicks, Cher, and Linda Ronstadt, Lola builds songs around strong melodies, big feelings, and a genre-bending spirit that feels both timeless and current. Ask her what genre she makes and she\u2019ll still say \u201cLinda Ronstadt,\u201d a wink to her love of fearless storytelling and emotional honesty.\n\nMomentum continues to build: three tracks from her debut EP Come of Age have received radio play on KXT and 88.1 Indie, and she appeared as an official SXSW 2025 showcase artist. With a return to SXSW and a Jambaloo appearance in 2026, plus her debut album slated for release this year, Lola is ready to take over the world one disco at a time.",

Their sound blends snarling guitars, punchy rhythms, and an emotional edge that swings between chaos and control. With a relentless live presence and hooks that hit like a gut punch, Lola Tried channels the messy urgency of feminine rage through a sharp, modern lens.",

    "description": "Change doesn\u2019t ask for permission; it disrupts and transforms. For Louie Lee, this truth began early. Growing up in a trailer park outside Detroit, he witnessed his mother working three jobs to make ends meet, instilling in him an unyielding work ethic. Battling a hearing impairment while soaking in the diverse sounds of metal, hip hop, rock, pop, and country, music became his escape and means of expression. The loss of his grandfather marked a turning point, igniting a new honesty in his songwriting that earned him Song of the Year at the Detroit Music Awards in 2022. Louie Lee's unique sound, labeled Country Hop & Roll, combines modern 808 basslines with country twang, crafting music that feels both grounded and dynamic. His lyrics delve into rarely explored emotional territories, balancing high-energy anthems with heartfelt ballads. Louie\u2019s live performances forge deep connections with audiences, transforming shows into communal experiences where fans actively participate. As a storyteller, Louie is reshaping country music\u2019s landscape, inviting non-country listeners to the genre while redefining its essence. His journey of creation through truth is just beginning.",

    "description": "Originally from the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina but currently living between LA, NYC and Richmond, VA; Lucaa (she/they) is the brainchild of singer/producer Stepha, who is a 2 spirit Afro-Indigenous artist whose genre-bending indie/alt-pop brand of music features raw and deceptively deep songwriting that pulls from their experiences as a young model in NYC, and being a queer BIPOC artist.\n\nAt a young age, Lucaa remembers listening to their father (who was a backup singer for Stevie Wonder, Earth Wind and Fire, and Michael Jackson) and mother (a trained opera singer). After teaching themself how to sing and play songs on piano by ear, Lucaa now takes a grungier approach to altpop, with influences harnessed from Radiohead, Billie Eilish, Willow, & girl in red.\n\nLucaa's career is growing quickly. A notable SXSW 2024 showcase early on led to major label interest and a fruitful year of performances and international branding campaigns with Leica Cameras and TurboTax. Lucaa was also a featured artist alongside Black Eyed Peas front man Taboo for Reserved Magazine, and appeared in Vogue Japan's October Edition (print), KEXP, Ones to Watch, and Them.",

    "description": "Kim Ho has escaped the clogged streets, blinding lights and noise of central Hong Kong to the region\u2019s northern mountains. Heartbreak and disillusionment are on her heels.\n\nIn these mountains, in sight of both the Chinese border and the international hub of downtown Hong Kong, Ho seeks to make sense of who she, and her bandmates, are. The pride they\u2019d felt as teenagers has long faded. Their multicultural progressive city has become politically oppressive since 2014, when anti-state protests were countered with beatings, politically-targeted arrests, and death threats from government officials. Says Ho, \u201cwe\u2019ve been steadily losing hope for a decade now\u201d.\n\nTheir response has been to create their own universe revolving around their studio practice space nestled in an unassuming industrial district on the edge of the city.\n\n'Instant Comfort' is the sound of a young band who've traveled the world, seen what it has to offer, held it for a moment, before watching it slip through their fingers. While the group\u2019s first recordings arrived buoyant on a wave of hopeful romanticism, this latest outing is more complex; mapping their journey from uncertainty to a renewed sense of self-reliance.",

Hailed as a symbol that rap is alive and well, his technical prowess and raw authenticity have earned nods from outlets like Power 105.1\u2019s The Breakfast Club, Complex Mag, Rap Caviar and more.\n\nAfter spending a week with the giants of Dreamville, it was clear that Marco\u2019s pen could hold weight in any room. His viral moment on Kai Cenat\u2019s Mafiathon stream only further solidified his undeniable talent and magnetic presence, showing the world that his confidence is rooted in skill, not hype. His latest album, Marco Plus vs. Tha Underworld, continues that statement featuring a standout collaboration with Smino and proving he can spar with some of the sharpest voices in the game. Whether it\u2019s on livestreams, stages, or in the booth, he\u2019s amongst those leading the charge.",

    "description": "For over two decades, Marissa Nadler has carved out a singular place in the musical landscape, where ethereal folk, shadowy Americana, ambient soundscapes, and experimental textures converge. Anchored by her unmistakable mezzo-soprano and fingerstyle guitar, Nadler\u2019s music conjures vivid emotional worlds\u2014intimate, otherworldly, and timeless.\nA prolific songwriter, Nadler has built a discography defined by spectral beauty and haunting lyricism. Her songs, dreamlike and lush, are rich with imagery and nuance. Nadler released her debut album, Ballads of Living and Dying, in 2004, a collection that announced her as a major voice in the underground. A skilled visual artist as well, Nadler\u2019s background in painting deeply informs the cinematic scope of her songs. Following her early work, she partnered with Sacred Bones and Bella Union for July (2014), marking a new chapter in creative clarity and critical acclaim. Strangers (2016), For My Crimes (2018), and The Path of the Clouds (2021) further expanded her sonic palette.\nHer 10th full-length, New Radiations, was released on August 15th. Expansive, melodic, and emotionally vivid, it captures Nadler at her most personal and visionary.",

The result: classic country tropes, turned on their heads through a switching of roles or a repossessed identity; delicate, revelatory explorations of what it means to be a friend, lover, or neither; and second person addresses to herself that offer both an onlooker\u2019s and her own perspective. After California, Hale spent time in Austin, TX and Portland, OR before relocating to Brooklyn, NY, where she recorded her debut EP, By My Own Ways, released July 2024, and began touring the US and Canada. After spending the better part of three years on the road, she moved back home to Austin, where she now resides.",

    "description": "Marni carries a down-to-earth and authentic energy. The indie rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 2022, and consists of Nicolas Lara (vocals, guitar), and Michaela Gradstein (vocals, guitar). The project began as Lara\u2019s solo work in Palm Springs, where he released the debut album Whiskey Girl, before evolving into a full band the following year.\n\nMarni intertwines heavy distorted guitars with beautifully soft moments, drawing on influences such as Title Fight, Greet Death, and Hovvdy. Their newest EP fml era (2025), produced by Corey Coffman of Gleemer, is a portrait of being down on your luck, with unpolished guitars, and emotionally direct storytelling.",

Her work blends intimate, emotionally precise songwriting with warm, modern production\u2014songs that feel confessional without losing their pop instincts.\n\nIn 2023, Maya gained viral traction with her breakout single \u201cMultiverse,\u201d sparking two East Coast tours, festival appearances including Levitate Music Festival and Musicians Corner, and support slots for artists such as Angie McMahon. Her momentum continued with her debut album American Doll (2025), a candid and self-aware body of work that explores desire, disillusionment, and identity with quiet confidence. Named Musicbed\u2019s Artist of the Year in 2025, Maya Manuela has emerged as a compelling new voice in indie pop\u2014equal parts tender, incisive, and unafraid to tell the truth.",

She\u2019s dancing on the gay bar bar-top with a sparkler fizzing in your cocktail.\n\nMEEK is not a work in progress. She is fully formed, earned her stripes, comes from nothing, nepo-baby baiting execution of timeless pop brilliance. While sounding directly descended from the DNA of famed countercultural misfits and bona fide pop aces, all strewn across the decades, her music is a no messing, straight shoot for the top.",

One of the most exciting new voices in the indie-rock scene, meg juxtaposes sweet vocals and opulent melodies with grungy guitars and weighty production. Keen wit and self-awareness shine through her lyrics, seamlessly weaving into the fabric of her ethereal shoegaze sound.\n\nmeg's debut album 'spittake' blends elements of grunge, contemporary pop, folk, and indie-rock, and showcases meg\u2019s ability to create dynamic, versatile, and effortlessly catchy music. Across the album\u2019s 11 tracks, she delivers musings on love, death, nostalgia, youth, anxiety, depression and everything in between, with a uniquely self-deprecating touch. \u201cThe story isn\u2019t necessarily linear,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut the main connection throughout is this unreliable narrator that you as a listener determine your view/trust of. They are incredibly inconsistent with their statements but I believe they think they\u2019re telling the truth.\u201d",

    "description": "Formed in the orbit of a South London pub, the spirit of M\u00ean An Tol\u2019s music can be traced back to frontman Bill Jefferson\u2019s own musical education in his native Cornwall where he\u2019d play folk sessions in and around the local pubs \u2013 in-fact the band name itself is taken from a rural site of ancient stones.\n\nThe band\u2019s instant chemistry (completed by mandolinist Felix Knox, bassist Max Silvey, drummer Tom Stevens and guitarist Robert Wiseman) is writ-large as they channel the raw grit of folk greats like The Pogues and The Waterboys alongside the mainstage urgency and confidence of Britpop giants. Perhaps most vitally, the songs proudly reclaim lost folk traditions with the use of the mandolin coupled with vibrant storytelling.\n\nThe band released two EP's in 2025, the most recent being September's 'This Land\u2019, featuring the track \u2018Not Ideal\u2019 - produced by Carlos O\u2019Connell of Fontaines DC who got involved after seeing them live.\n\nThroughout the year M\u00ean An Tol have gone from strength to strength. They've picked up praise from NME, Rolling Stone UK, The Independent, DIY, So Young and more. At radio the band were on the B List at BBC 6 Music with single 'Not Ideal' and recorded a Maida Vale session for Steve Lamacq. On his Apple Music radio show Elton John has given two different tracks a spin, stating \"I really love their sound\".\n\nThe band played two shows at 2025 Glastonbury Festival alongside European festival runs, UK touring and dates supporting The Libertines and Miles Kane. They also played The Great Escape and finished the year with a packed out London headline at The Lexington.",

Michael's trademark sound features live instruments sitting seamlessly with sampled grooves to create organic, classic textures. The Lion sound is always funky, always strong and always ready for the floor.\n\nMichael was a part of the multi-genre style of DJing that catapulted his adopted Philadelphia to the pinnacle of the DJ world in the early 2000s. His years of seasoning as a DJ have seen him play all styles imaginable all across North America and Europe. As a part of the duo RCMP, his work foreshadowed the emergence of Nu-Disco before the genre even had a name. Now, as Michael The Lion, he is pushing the boundaries of funk in modern dance music.",

    "description": "Modern Cinema Master is a four-piece band formed in Taipei, whose sound is heavily influenced by the independent rock of the 1990s. Their music is driven by sharp noise, post-punk energy, and lo-fi anthems.\n\nSince 2019, the band has remained true to its roots, focusing wholeheartedly on creation. To date, they have released two EPs, three singles, and two double-CD albums, amassing more than forty original songs. Their live performances are equally renowned, frequently selling out thousand-capacity venues in Taiwan and China. In 2025, they were invited to perform at the Incheon Pentaport Rock Festival in Korea, where they received an enthusiastic response.\n\nModern Cinema Master\u2019s music is simultaneously raw and refined, pairing poetic, thought-provoking lyrics with a powerful sonic edge. Their track \u201cI Want to Kill Romance and Murder Poetry\u201d earned Taiwan\u2019s most prestigious independent music award for Best Rock Song, with the jury praising it as \u201csavagely precise, capturing the very essence of rock.\u201d\n\nBlending fierce, driving melodies with blunt, hard-hitting lyrics, The Modern Cinema Masters fuse critique and irony into one powerful voice, a sound that captures the essence of our times.",

    "description": "Montclair is the Austin, Texas-based, independent folk-rock project resulting from four friends\u2019 expression of joy and curiosity for life. Montclair's sound explores themes of self-discovery and emerging adulthood, from the beloved surf rock groove of \u201cPastel Lies\u201d to the forlorn folk guitar wave in \u201cPassing Through\u201d. Their debut album, \u201cHeart is Alive!\u201d explores their musical potential and emotional range, both on full display in the first two singles, the titular and upbeat \u201cHeart is Alive!\u201d and the enigmatic rock powerhouse \u201cComing to the Rescue\u201d. With a dynamic range of music, Montclair\u2019s live performances are energetic and engaging, and they are known to have a strong crowd pull in Texas. Montclair has been invited to play onstage to crowds at festivals and iconic Texas venues such as House of Blues Houston, and a sold-out Antone's Nightclub, with nationally touring acts like Echosmith, The Brook and The Bluff, Dayglow, Giant Rooks, The Wldlfe, Briscoe, and many more. They look forward to the release of their debut album and the adventures and inspirations that await them ahead.",

Morgan began performing at just three years old and by eighteen she\u2019d joined Rudimental as a globally-touring vocalist. Her solo debut \u2018My Year\u2019 spotlit her brand of sparkling pop, before a collaboration with Ebenezer (\u2018Mulholland Drive\u2019) earned her over 10 million streams. Her subsequent EP \u2018Alien\u2019 referenced golden-era pop. That same year, \u2018ADCT\u2019 (written when she was 17) soared to the #1 spot on both TikTok Trending Sounds and the UK Top 50, earning over 30 million streams. Morgan also co-wrote and featured on Rudimental & Digga D\u2019s \u2018Be the One\u2019, Sigma\u2019s \u2018Adrenaline Rush\u2019 and Purple Disco Machine's most recent album. She\u2019s been writing for some of the biggest K-pop artists (including NCT\u2019s Jaehyun, TWICE & Aespa).\n\nMorgan released her EP \u2018Emotional Gangster\u2019 last October and went on to sell out her first UK headline tour at the end of the year including a show at London\u2019s iconic Jazz Cafe. She turned up the heat with the release of \u2018One Man\u2019 featuring the legendary Beenie Man, paired with the unapologetic anthem \u2018Bad Gyal Energy\u2019.",

Inspired by tumbados but influenced by pop, trap, and urban melancholy, his music is honest, unfiltered, and deeply personal.\n\nBuilt without shortcuts or backing, MOSMO represents a generation raised on Peso Pluma, Natanael Cano, and Junior H, while carving a lane entirely his own.\nHe\u2019s not chasing virality. He\u2019s building something real",

There\u2019s humor in the pain, soul in the simplicity, and zero interest in staying in one lane. MURTY isn\u2019t here to sound perfect. He\u2019s here to sound like himself, flaws, feelings, and all. He's not just making music. He\u2019s making moments you laugh at, relate to, and secretly replay.",

    "description": "Nightbus are a brooding, cinematic two-piece (4 members live) blending post-punk, trip-hop, and late-night electronica into something dark, hypnotic and unmistakably their own. Formed in Manchester UK in 2023, their music captures the anxious beauty of city life after hours\u2014dripping in atmosphere - bass-heavy and emotionally raw. With haunting vocals, reverb-soaked guitars, and minimalist beats, they echo the ghosts of The Knife, Portishead, early Cure, Chromatics and the XX, all while carving out a space all their own.\n\nThe early demos caught the ears of tastemaker label and magazine So Young, who released two 7\"s from the band, one in 2023 and another in 2024 - both selling out with champions at BBC R1 and 6 Music, The Guardian, NME, The Fader, Brooklyn Vegan, The Line Of Best Fit, Dummy, DIY + Dork supporting the singles.\n\nUnderground shows followed leading to festival appearances at Left Of The Dial, Blue Dot, Manchester Psychfest and Float Along, headline shows at Supersonic in Paris, Manchester and London and support shows with Rock Action signings Bdrmm across the UK.\n\nNightbus released their debut album 'Passenger' on Melodic records, October 2025 to critical acclaim.",

Her performances blend delicate, breathy vocals with moments of raw intensity; creating an atmosphere that shifts between vulnerability and bursts of noise.\n\nReleasing her long-awaited fourth album, Uydurdu\u011fumuz Oyunlarla (\u201cThe Games We Made Up\u201d) digitally in May 2024 and on vinyl in January 2025, she delivered her most intricate and emotionally resonant work yet. The tracks promise the listener a forty-five-minute uninterrupted journey while combining political symbolism in lyrics with innovative musical arrangements. The album also elegantly portrays Nilipek.\u2019s musical evolution since her first album in 2015.\n\nThis year, the Turkish singer-songwriter is releasing her first fully English single, Safe Coast, in collaboration with the producer Cody Fitzgerald (Stolen Jars). The song captures the search for meaning and security in an ever-shifting, and increasingly perilous world, while creating a sanctuary in its sound.",

    "description": "Olivia Ellen Lloyd will try anything once. From flight attendant school in Dallas to producing theater in New York City and teaching in Guatemala, Lloyd sought an adventurous life, but struggled to find a greater sense of purpose. That is, until she found her way back to music. Lloyd channels her restless spirit into songs that pay homage to her Appalachian roots while charting fresh territory for a sound that is uniquely her own.\n\nHeavily influenced by country, folk, and indie rock, Lloyd\u2019s sound combines the rooted sounds of her traditional Appalachian upbringing with the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants nature of her current life. She is inspired by the rich sounds of New York City, the peaceful quiet of her small West Virginia hometown, and life on the road in between.\n\nHer 2025 sophomore record \"Do It Myself\" landed her debut appearances at Mountain Stage, Americana Fest, and Brooklyn Folk Festival and her debut album, Loose Cannon, has been streamed over 1 million times while Olivia has been busy crossing the country opening for artists like Kelsey Waldon, Tommy Prine, and Jobi Riccio, winning songwriting contests (Kerrville in 2023), and generally eating life down to the rind.",

She has toured the world performing with Grammy- winning rock, pop, and country acts, using her experiences in varied musical contexts to perfect her own sound. As a solo artist born in Manhattan, NY, the songs she writes and the way she sings them are steeped in the jazz tradition that she picked up during her high school days at jazz clubs in Manhattan, but with an indie pop spin. Many of her lyrics reflect her experiences on the road, and she has built a loyal following online through her presence on the scene as a writer and musician. Liv has also toured her own project throughout the US; her latest EP \u201cReturn to Sender\u201d is a culmination of her past few years of adventure, heartbreak, and growth.",

    "description": "\u201cMusic will never stop evolving, and I will continue to grow with it.\u201d ~Oscar Ortiz\n\nBorn into an artistic family of Regional Mexican artists, Oscar Ortiz is the youngest of four leading artists in the genre: Gerardo, William, and Kevin Ortiz. However, Oscar shines on his own with his youthful style and talent as a composer, fusing cumbia and ballads with modern corridos.\n\nHis solo music began to transcend borders with the singles \u201cEl Del C8\u201d (2023) and \u201cFIRST LOVE\u201d (2024) with Edgardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez; the latter catapulting him onto the global scene with over 200 million streams on Spotify, a No. 1 spot on Billboard Regional Mexican Airplay, platinum certifications, and virality on TikTok.\nThis phenomenon was followed by other songs that consolidated his musical identity, such as \"ALVRGZO\" (with Alex Favela and C\u00f3digo FN), \"Anillos\" (with Oscar Mayd\u00f3n), \"Modo B\u00e9lico\" (with Polo Gonz\u00e1lez), \"23/7,\" and \"Ice Cream\" (with Los Mismos de la M).\n\nOscar Ortiz didn't stop there. In 2025, he continued to reap hits like \"Y Si Te Vas,\" a single released with Carin Le\u00f3n, which peaked at #5 and is currently #7 on Billboard's Regional Mexican Airplay charts. Additionally, he has other songs released this year, such as \u201cAplauso\u201d with Matisse, \u201cAMIGOS PARA QU\u00c9\u201d, \u201cCARO,\u201d and soon \u201cLAST KISS\u201d which will be released in October 2025. Added to this is his biggest project to date: his first studio album, projected to be released in January 2026. In Oscar's words, this project brings \u201ca lot of love and heartbreak\u2026 corridos, versatile sounds, a little bit of everything,\u201d in addition to collaborations with artists from different regional currents.",

On their second album, \u2018Hidden Album\u2019(2025), Our Shame approach it like wallflowers at an underground rave, documenting the unspeakable with a quiet but unflinching lens. Built on a foundation of folktronica and synth-pop, their palette stretches from acoustic guitars and field recordings to splashes of Trip-hop, UK Garage and techno.\n\nWith a unique mix of soulful vocals, synthesizers, guitars, drum machines, their sound fuses the cold textures of digital precision with the warmth of analog tones. The duo has performed at notable events like Reeperbahn Festival 2024 (Germany), Minami Wheel (Japan), Megaport Festival (Taiwan) and Sonik Philippines.",

    "description": "P.H.0 [P-H-\"zero\"] is a NYC-based SILKPUNK quartet reshaping the city's underground. Fusing the raw, intense metal riffs with the haunting cry of the traditional Chinese erhu and techno-dystopian synths, they craft sounds that are at once chaotic and controlled, futuristic and ancient. Their live shows\u2014referred to as \"rituals\"\u2014transform ancient Taoist traditions into ear-crushing soundscapes that defy time, crashing into chaotic mosh pits under visceral strobing lights to create what some describe as a rave in an abandoned shrine from Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nTheir momentum has carried them from NYC festivals like New Colossus and Punk Island to sold-out shows across the East Coast, proving their reach in every environment\u2014from the historic Gramercy Theatre, where they were handpicked by Danish prog-metal giants VOLA to support their North American tour, to inside an abandoned tunnel where they performed for more than 500 ravers. They were further recognized by NPR's Tiny Desk as a top 50 \"Top Shelf\" artist in 2025, and by Bandcamp Daily, who praised their debut album KARMA for \u201creimagining what Asian music might sound like.\u201d P.H.0 continues to build a cult following, one ritual at a time.",

They\u2019re mindful of tradition, but deeply informed by his singular background \u2014 as a teenage Midwestern church pianist, a Manhattan piano bar survivor, and a touring member of pioneering queer country outfit, Lavender Country. The stories are his, but the feeling they convey \u2014 love, loneliness, lust, and so on \u2014 are, hopefully, still universal.",

    "description": "(New album DREAMERS BELIEVERS ILLUSIONISTS PREACHERS out in November 2025)\nP\u00e4r Hagstr\u00f6m has always moved along the outer edges of music \u2013 from the first stumbling chords on his family\u2019s pump organ in Huskvarna, through 90s death metal and 70s hard rock, to the innermost heart of gospel. It\u2019s a journey shaped as much by philosophy, literature, and theater as by rock clubs and church halls, eventually arriving at a universe of its own where drama and soulful preaching merge into one.\nAs a frontman, Hagstr\u00f6m is as much a preacher as he is a singer. His voice carries a natural theatrical force \u2013 raspy and silky at the same time \u2013 with an instinctive readiness to let the music chafe, sweat, and hypnotize. Drawing inspiration from Tom Waits, Led Zeppelin, Mavis Staples and the Blind Boys of Alabama, and together with his band Charlatans of Love, he has in recent years shaped a new musical entity where gospel, soul, psychedelic rock, and funk meet in something as seductive as it is uncompromising.\n\nDREAMERS BELIEVERS ILLUSIONISTS PREACHERS is a continuation of the mini-album The End Again (2024), picking up where the story left off.",

    "description": "Patriarchy is the Los Angeles industrial pop duo of Actually Huizenga and AJ English, exploring sex, power, subversion, and death where desire and fear collide. Known for chaotic, boundary-pushing live performances that dissolve the line between performer and audience, the band fuses infectious electronic pulse with industrial metal, distorted synths, and spoken-word intensity.\n\nSince their breakout releases Asking For It and The Unself, Patriarchy sharpened their sound into something harder and more immediate on 2025\u2019s Manual for Dying, produced in collaboration with Twin Shadow. The album drives their industrial roots deeper into dark club territory while amplifying their theatrical edge.\n\nTheir live reputation has carried them from the experimental extremity of Roadburn Festival to the indie forward energy of Wide Awake Festival, the darkwave revivalism of Cruel World Festival, and the metal intensity of Brutal Assault \u2014 proving Patriarchy move seamlessly between underground art spaces and large-scale international stages.\n\nAt SXSW 2026, they arrive sharper than ever.",

    "description": "Pei-Yu Hung is a Taiwanese vocalist and multidisciplinary performer whose work bridges pop, performance art, and contemporary theater. Born in Kaohsiung and based in Taipei, she approaches music through a \u201cbody-based performance\u201d philosophy, integrating dance, voice, and visual storytelling to expand the expressive range of modern pop. Her collaborations span independent musicians, theater troupes, and experimental artists, making her one of Taiwan\u2019s most versatile and forward-thinking performers.\n\nIn 2022, Pei-Yu released her debut album \u2018Silver Lining\u2019 , a ten-track journey through light and shadow, personal reflection, and emotional subtlety. The album earned eight nominations at the Golden Melody Awards, winning Best New Artist. In 2023, her song \u201cThe Same\u201d (\u540c\u6b3e), the theme for the film \u2018Day Off\u2019 won Best Original Film Song at the Golden Horse Awards.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the most accomplished female vocalists in the Mandarin-speaking music scene over the past decade, Pei-Yu Hung continues to define contemporary Mandarin-language music with her distinctive voice and artistry. Seamlessly moving between lyrical pop and avant-garde soundscapes, she merges experimentation with expressive depth, redefining contemporary Mandarin music and bringing a bold, fresh dimension of Taiwanese sound to the global stage.\n\nPei-Yu released her highly anticipated second album \u2018Still Moving\u2019 in October 2025, featuring collaborations with artists from Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. For the new single \u201cIt's Nothing Personal\u201d, she enlisted Polish director Chris Rudz, who previously directed dance videos for Japanese artist Fujii Kaze, to helm the music video, with choreography created in collaboration with Japanese choreographer Chikako Takemoto, showcasing a dynamic cross-border, cross-disciplinary creative energy.",

    "description": "On their intoxicating new album, Thank the Lord...it\u2019s The Pink Stones, Pinkston and his bandmates do precisely that, offering up a joyful, adventurous take on \u201960s twang that blurs the lines between cosmic country, folk, bluegrass, soul, and psychedelic rock. Recorded once again with co-producer/engineer Henry Barbe (Drive-By Truckers, Deerhunter) in the band\u2019s hometown of Athens, GA, the collection showcases a more deliberate, mature side of The Pink Stones\u2019 sound, one that reflects all the personal and sonic growth that\u2019s defined the last few years for the hard touring five-piece. The songs on Thank the Lord... are humble and timeless, full of wry, sardonic wit and rich, evocative storytelling, and the performances are easygoing and amiable, with an effortlessly natural feel that belies the masterful craftsmanship behind them. The result is a record that wears its influences proudly on its sleeve, even as it a subverts expectation, a work of poignant longing and playful humor that tips its cap to everyone from Merle Haggard and Earl Scruggs to Don Williams and The Byrds as it looks both forwards and backwards all at once.",

    "description": "Chicago-born and Atlanta-raised, Raq Baby is carving out his own lane in hip-hop with an unapologetic sound that blends raw street emotion with melodic vulnerability. His music captures the highs and lows of his come-up \u2014 gritty, honest, and charged with energy that connects instantly with the youth of his generation. Raq continues to captivate his audience with is newest project I Never Gave AF, a bold statement of self-determination that earned him a placement on local playlists and music blogs across the South. His sound fuses the unfiltered storytelling of classic trap with drill rap \u2014 creating music that hits hard both in the club and through headphones. On stage, Raq\u2019s presence is magnetic. He\u2019s performed alongside artists like SahBabii, YTB Fatt, Hunxho, and Vonoff1700, bringing an unmatched energy that\u2019s helped him sell out his first headline show at Atlanta\u2019s Aisle 5 and secure bookings at Rolling Loud. Beyond the music, Raq Baby stands as a voice for authenticity \u2014 a young artist who\u2019s seen struggle, growth, and triumph, and channels all of it into his art. Raq Baby is more than an artist \u2014 he\u2019s a movement in the making.",

    "description": "The Red Eye Gamblers are a psychedelic southern rock band with a uniquely Austin, Texas sound. They bridge elements of rock, bluegrass, and jammy psychedelia to create a new experience with every show.\n\nThey have a deep repertoire, and in over two years of live shows, they have never played the same set list twice. They will often venture outside of their normal 5-piece lineup featuring a saxophone, djembe, and harmonica to create an unforgettable live experience.\n\nThey released their debut single \"Let You Down Easy\" in October 2024. A fan favorite from live shows, \"Let You Down Easy\" is a fast-paced song about simply saying goodbye. In September 2025, they followed it up with their next single \"Whiskey Memories.\" \"Whiskey Memories\" is a powerful ballad about reminiscing on the past and learning to move on from the troubles it may have caused. The song features introspective lyrics, instrumental breakdowns, and showcases even more of what The Red Eye Gamblers have to offer.\n\nFrom starting with backyard shows in east Austin, all the way to the Continental Club and the incredible stages at SXSW 2025, The Red Eye Gamblers are one of THE bands to watch for SXSW 2026 & beyond",

    "description": "The Reverent Few emerged from Chicago\u2019s blues scene and have called Austin home for over a decade. They are a band bound by shared history, raw honesty, and a lived-in belief in the power of music to connect and heal. With voices that carry like old hymns and instrumentation that cuts with both grit and grace, their songs aren\u2019t just played, they\u2019re inhabited. There\u2019s gospel in the bones, blues in the breath, and rock and roll in the resolve. Their debut album, Ain\u2019t No Place to Be (2020), was recorded in Dripping Springs and released through Bearpath Records. It's an eight-track collection steeped in soul both sonically and spiritually featuring contributions from Anthony Farrell of The Greyhounds. Critics praised its emotional weight and its blend of warmth, pain, and resilience. Their latest single, The World Will Be Wood to You, recorded live to tape at DogStar Studios, is a raw, analog meditation on loss and grace. Written during quiet reckonings and bedside goodbyes, it holds ache and light in equal measure. It's an offering, a gesture toward gentleness in a fractured world. The Reverent Few remind us that tenderness still matters, that community still holds.",

Writing primarily on her own, she creates music that feels grounded and familiar - and yet wholly her own. Influenced by both the country classics and also Americana with a modern edge, her songs lean on acoustic guitars, simple arrangements, and lyrics that leave room to breathe. Whether written quietly at home or brought to life in the studio with producers Caleb Nelson (Mt. Joy) and Patrick Lyons (Colter Wall, Luke Grimes, Noeline Hoffman), Saige\u2019s music shows a deep respect for timeless storytelling and feels imminent for a breakthrough in the year ahead.",

    "description": "Saint Avangeline is an Atlanta-based independent artist, merging ethereal sounds with raw, unfiltered vocals, crafting a striking contrast that mirrors the depths of human emotion. Deeply rooted in her journey with mental health, domestic abuse, & growing up queer, her songs offer an honest exploration of inner turmoil, rage, hope, & resilience.\nGrowing up with her head in a sketchbook & performing in various orchestras, and jazz bands, combined with her unique sound-to-color synesthesia known as Chromesthesia, Avangeline focuses on writing and creating from a color palette. Music is like painting, every sound is a different texture, color, and form. She also often listens to music in languages she doesn't understand, are made up or distorted, or that contain no words at all. She found that she could focus more deeply on the emotion embedded within the sound and she would often memorize entire orchestral scores and video game soundtracks as a child.\nFocusing on painting an image not only through words but through the very fiber of sound, her music strives to transcend the barriers of language and strike hearts in the way hers was.",

    "description": "To a growing group of those in the know, the name SAMWOY signals epic, genre-warping\nmusic that cuts through the Canadian landscape with rare force. Led by Montreal-based auteur\nSam Woywitka, the project has evolved into a powerhouse collective of the city\u2019s most\nadventurous musicians. SAMWOY\u2019s tracks veer from ambient serenity and lush orchestration to explosive synths and\ndistorted rhythms, all anchored by Woywitka\u2019s obsession with emotional extremes. His\nsophomore album Even Sad Boys Like To Have Fun is out now and has become a\nbreakthrough release, charting on Earshot for 48 consecutive weeks while earning national\nand international attention. Live, SAMWOY is a visceral experience volatile, beautiful, unpredictable. The project has\ndelivered acclaimed showcases at POP Montreal and M for Montreal, as well as a standout\nperformance at SXSW.\nRooted in themes of chaos, catharsis, and redemption shaped in part by Woywitka\u2019s near-fatal\ncar accident in his Vancouver Island hometown. SAMWOY\u2019s music thrives on contrast:\npost-punk grit against electronic gloss, euphoria against collapse. It\u2019s a world where nothing is\noff limits and beauty is always carved from the wreckage.",

    "description": "Irish/Brighton-based artist Sarah Crean is an indie-pop singer-songwriter whose music combines emotional clarity with layered, melodic arrangements. Her 2023 EP Death by Laundry featured the breakout single \u201c2:00am,\u201d now streamed over 7.5 million times on Spotify, and earned support from BBC Introducing, BBC Radio 1, The Line of Best Fit, Clash, Nialler9, and Spotify editorial playlists. The first single from her upcoming album, \u201c22 Angel,\u201d has already reached 80,000 streams and was featured on New Pop UK.\n\nSarah has toured the UK supporting acts including Florence Road, U.S. Girls, and Bombay Bicycle Club, with highlights such as a performance at the O2 Forum London alongside CMAT. Now independent and on the verge of her debut album - created entirely by women and inspired by the myth of Calypso - Crean explores heartbreak, home, and everything in between. With the album due mid-2026, she is emerging as one of alt-indie pop\u2019s most compelling new voices.",

    "description": "Sasha Wrist is a bilingual singer-songwriter and vocal artist from Venezuela, now based in Los\nAngeles. Her genre-bending sound fuses the grit of hip-hop, the pulse of electronic music, the\nsensuality of R&B, and the emotional depth of Latin pop.\n\nHer voice first gained traction in the global music scene through the viral success of her Splice\nvocal packs, which have been downloaded and sampled by producers worldwide, incorporating Sasha\u2019s vocals into standout tracks like \u201cFamax\u201d and \u201cPerreo\u201d.\n\nIn late 2024, Sasha released her debut album, LA CHAMA. More than just a debut, the album serves as a love letter to her Venezuelan roots. Tracks like \u201cSUR,\u201d \u201cCORO,\u201d \u201cKRTELUO,\u201d and \u201cLLANEROS\u201d explore her upbringing, resilience, and self-discovery.\n\nBeginning in early 2025, Sasha made a sharp artistic pivot with the release of The Wrist\nWave, a melodic house EP with tracks like \u201cYa Te Borre,\u201d and \u201cIGOT2.\" She also collaborated with some of the world\u2019s biggest phonk artists, Ariis, YB Wasg'ood, and Nakama, on their track \u201cLUNA LA.\u201d\n\nSasha Wrist's next project, titled \"404:NJD\" will release in February 15 and will bring her back to rap roots.",

The Boston music scene veteran, who helms The Sheila Divine, has spent decades confounding expectations with songs that deftly weave power-punching political criticism amongst mundane daily frustrations. Songs that expose purest grief alongside deepest love.\n\nThe Sheila Divine\u2019s upcoming sixth album, The Middle Ages (out DATE on Trash Casual), is a deeply human document of everyday life. Across ten new tracks Perrino bares his soul and searches his heart in songs that navigate the wide gamut of lived experience: from the wrenching loss of his mother, through parental anxieties for his own children\u2019s wellbeing, to the strains of congested city life, fractured relationships, and rage at what his nation has turned into.",

    "description": "Sir Eddie C is designing the next era of hip-hop from the middle of America.\n\nThe St. Louis\u2013based artist represents a new St. Louis: forward-facing, culturally fluent, and unwilling to wait for co-signs. He calls his music \u201cregular people rap,\u201d but what distinguishes him is scale of vision. Each release arrives as a fully realized world, complete with its own aesthetic system, narrative arc, live direction, and sold-out limited merch.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t drop projects. He builds worlds.\n\nConcepts unfold through alter egos, staged moments, and immersive performances that feel cinematic without losing emotional precision. Beyond his own catalog, his annual Sir Eddie C & Friends show has grown into a packed, independently produced homecoming concert, proof that his audience doesn\u2019t just listen. They participate, invest, and return.\n\nWith a sharp pen, controlled visual language, and commanding stage presence, Sir Eddie C operates as a full-package artist and multidisciplinary brand architect. He\u2019s not waiting to be discovered. He\u2019s constructing something too intentional to ignore.",

Slomo is kicking off 2026 with a string of single releases on Spaceflight Records, starting with \"Fresh Bread\" - a hypnotically catch tune for folks who love paranoia and malaise with their pop.",

    "description": "Social Order is a Los Angeles and Las Vegas\u2013based trio blending melodic pop, post punk, and darkwave into a sound that feels both cinematic and intimate. Formed during the isolation of 2020, the band features Mason Musso and Anthony Improgo of Metro Station alongside Andrew Ward of Nuwave Fighters. Their music explores the tension between nostalgia and reinvention, light and shadow, intimacy and distance.\n\nThey gained early attention with their debut EP How To Lie, followed by singles Worst Way, All My Life, Boys, and the EP Strangers, earning placement on Spotify\u2019s Darkwave playlist and praise from Alternative Press and Post-Punk.com. Entirely self-produced and self-directed, Social Order maintain a strong DIY ethos. The band made their major festival debut at Cruel World and completed a North American tour with French Police in November, continuing to expand their shadowy, emotionally charged world.",

    "description": "someshiit is a Taiwanese hip-hop artist known for his unique blend of bedroom rap and live band arrangements. Drawing influence from UK, Japanese, and Korean hip-hop, he emerged in 2019 with the breakout single \u201cThose Who Told Me to Quit Smoking Are All Dead\u201d (5M+ views on YouTube), the track\u2019s poetic and raw storytelling quickly resonated with a new generation of listeners. His debut album \u2018A FOOL\u2019 pushed even further, fusing gritty lyricism with lush, genre-blurring production alongside collaborators like Samjoo (deca joins), Sam Yang, and Pei-Yu Hung, earning him Best New Artist at the Golden Melody Awards, Taiwan\u2019s most prestigious music honor.\nFrom TV screens \u201cThe Rappers 2\u201d to major Taiwanese festival stages like Megaport, Vagabond, and FireBall Fest, he weaves lush live-band arrangements as the backbone of his sound, layered with razor-sharp, prose-like lyricism that cuts straight to the core. His self-produced shows consistently sell out, including his first overseas performance in Hong Kong, proving that his music\u2019s emotional gravity transcends borders. Internationally, he has worked alongside acclaimed Japanese rapper maco marets and South Korean psychedelic band CHS, garnering attention from various media outlets and hip-hop labels.\n\nWith a reimagined EP set to drop in 2025 marking six years since his breakout hit, someshiit isn\u2019t just evolving, he\u2019s shaping a new creative language for Mandarin rap, redefining its boundaries one verse at a time.",

Formed in the early 2010s amid a context marked by violence, migration, and social fragmentation, the project transforms those realities into an energetic and celebratory sound grounded in popular dance traditions.\n\nBlending cumbia with elements of rock, punk, and other hybrid influences, Sonido Cachimbo creates music that invites collective joy while carrying the memory and resilience of border communities. Their live performances are known for their high energy, festive atmosphere, and strong connection with diverse audiences on both sides of the border.\n\nThe project has released two full-length albums, Tropicumbia Fronteriza (2014) and Fiesta Popular (2017), the latter co-produced by Rodrigo Rojas of the Chilean band Juanafe, and has collaborated with artists such as Clemente Castillo (Jumbo), Edna Nao, and Paulina del Campo. In 2024, Sonido Cachimbo released \u201cMonitor,\u201d a reinterpretation of the song by Volov\u00e1n. The group is currently working on a new EP of original material planned for vinyl release.",

Their current mission: to reinvent what it means to be a Hip-Hop artist in the capital city of Texas.

Comparable to Wu-Tang Clan, Brockhampton, Flatbush Zombies, ETC. Consisting of members from all around the country and spanning multiple generations, their sound is a collage of the different Hip-Hop practices, melded together by the diverse backgrounds of every member.

Spacestation has in the past couple of years gained a reputation as the country\u2019s most exciting new rock group and its most proliferate live band.\n\nLike Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine before them, Spacestation aspire to redefine what noise can be within the context of pop music.\n\nTheir music combines inventive use of alternate tunings, guitar strumming and feedback, with the intensity of shoegaze, catchy Krautrock rhythms and the attitude of 60s psychedelia, to create a new, jogging, sonic landscape that makes you waste away insightful nights dancing with strangers.",

Wry and sardonic, the record balances humor and existential dread, blending retro synths, vintage drum machines, and fuzzed-out guitars into an intoxicating mix of analog and electronic sounds. Nods to Randy Newman, Lou Reed, Warren Zevon, and Tom Petty shine through as Thomas holds a mirror to modern life, delivering a whip-smart meditation on the absurdity and beauty of living and loving in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of ways, it felt impossible for me to not write about this stuff,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cI leaned into what felt interesting and current and funny, and tried to make something visceral and honest.\u201d\n\nAfter releasing his 2019 solo debut Hangin\u2019 Tough, he moved to Athens, GA in 2020 and joined indie rock band Futurebirds as their keyboardist. \u201cIt was a fantastic opportunity,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut it kept me away from home and from my own music.\u201d His 2024 sophomore album The Joke of Life earned rave reviews, and in 2025 he stepped away from Futurebirds to devote himself fully to creating Cynical Vision.",

    "description": "Spike F*ck is a rare figure in contemporary music: direct, disarming, and impossible to pin down. Emerging from Melbourne\u2019s underground in the late 2010s with The Smackwave EP, Spike fused bleak synth-pop, post-punk melodrama, and brutally honest songwriting into something both vulnerable and confrontational. Armed with only a backing track and a microphone, early live shows saw Spike sing candidly about addiction, gender, dysfunctional love, and collapse: a kind of wounded sincerity that quickly drew a cult following. Just as things seemed to be breaking open, Spike disappeared, retreating from public life amid a personal reckoning.\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus -- during which time rumours swirled about death, institutions, or becoming a monk -- Spike returned sober, clear-eyed, and transformed. The music that followed is bigger, wilder, and more alive. Performed with a rotating full band, the new material draws from \u201870s glam, spiritual soul, and damaged rock and roll, but always filtered through Spike\u2019s unmistakable voice: bruised, intense, poetic.\n\nThese are songs about recovery, identity, survival, and letting go not sanitised, not triumphant, but real. Where the early work stared into the void, the new work steps forward with purpose. It\u2019s not a reinvention. It\u2019s an evolution, one born from chaos, now grounded in clarity.",

Known for their \u201890s indie rock style, Stalefish looks to bring their sound into the modern era, embracing their most earwormy ideas.\n\nSongwriter Dalton Hausman was inspired by watching Royel Otis at Austin City Limits when his girlfriend turned to him and said, \u201cYou could do this!\u201d This vote of confidence lit a fire underneath Hausman to take a stab at writing a radio hit. The lead single \u201c1000 Books a Day\u201d came directly out of that challenge and kickstarted the project.\n\nCreating New Pop Experiments Vol. 1 was transformative for the band, involving remote collaboration across different cities, digital sharing of ideas, and intense bursts of in-person creativity.\n\nMusically, the recordings offer a ripe sonic landscape complete with strings, horns, synthesizer, and lots of electric guitar. True to the lyrical tradition of the band, the songs are about romantic love, self-love and reassurance, and perhaps most importantly, how to party.\n\nThe full EP, New Pop Experiments Vol. 1, is available now via Happen Twice!",

Haunting melodies and brooding soundscapes channel the spirit of goth-driven acts from that era, offering a sonic journey steeped in existential reflection and melancholic beauty. A true embodiment of modern dark romanticism, Stare Away continues to captivate audiences seeking meaning in the shadows.",

With lyrics steeped in people-watching, dreams, nature, and existential observation, their songwriting draws from both introspection and their surroundings. Ben and Jordy met by chance in Liverpool 2 years ago sparking a lightning-in-a-bottle creative partnership. What started as casual jam sessions in a basement quickly evolved, with sessions ranging from stripped-back recordings on a broken classical guitar to studio lock-ins fuelled by long walks through rural Wales and a shared commitment to imperfection. In May 2025 they performed their first show as a band at Permanent Records Roadhouse. Debut single \"What About Jane\" is a grungy, folk-inflected reflection on identity, societal perception, and the expectations we\u2019re forced to confront to uncover who we really are.",

Inspired by the likes of Judee Sill, Liz Phair, and Kacey Musgraves, Storey\u2019s feathery vocals blend the melodies of pop with the pang of folk, at once gentle and all-consuming. The album features moments of restraint and rupture: intricate finger-picked melodies give way to electric guitar rumbles and wails alongside the humor, drama and catchiness of 60\u2019s girl group pop. Her other musical projects include fronting the band M0NOGAMY alongside Livia Reiner and Matthew Danger Lippman, and playing guitar and keys for Ida, Lola Kirke, Calder the Destroyer, Luella and The Hedons.",

    "description": "With a Spellemann (norwegian Grammy) nomination for their debut album in hand, S\u016bn Byrd is ready to kick off the new campaign for the upcoming album In Paradiso, heavily inspired by American and British soul from the 60s and 70s.\n\nWith a horn section that never rests, basslines that drive the songs forward, neatly ironed pants, and undeniable coolness, S\u016bn Byrd could just as easily be born in New Orleans as in Oslo. But it's in Norway that they've first made a name for themselves. They released their Spellemann-nominated debut album in 2024 and have already played over 250 concerts together. You can just try to imagine how tight S\u016bn Byrd sounds live, and then add a little more. Now, they're about to release In Paradiso, their first album on Jansen Records.\n\nOn In Paradiso, you'll be served soulful tracks that follow in the footsteps of artists like Leon Bridges, Thee Sacred Souls, and Sharon Jones and The Dap-Kings. Johan Helland's vocals are perhaps the first thing that stands out, with its distinctive tone, range, and vulnerability, but it\u2019s when the whole band comes in that you\u2019re truly dazzled. The keys, horns, guitar, and bass all find their place, seamlessly shifting between being a musical locomotive and charming you into submission with beautiful ballads.\n\nS\u016bn Byrd\u2019s music is universal and timeless, and there\u2019s really nothing that sounds like this on the Norwegian music scene today. It\u2019s perfect for large festival stages, would make a great soundtrack for countless films, or simply while you hang out after closing time at a smoke-filled off-license bar in the southern U.S.\n\nPosting Spotify link here, since it did not work below: https://open.spotify.com/artist/32PUtLgz3SzD5Ihjdxoa6r?si=-g3wUV8ARxy3Htw3bXNW0Q",

    "description": "Born and raised in San Diego\u2019s surf-rock scene, Sun Room went from getting their house shows shut down for playing too loudly to selling out venues across a dozen countries. Formed in 2021, the band gained viral attention after two songs featured on Netflix\u2019s Outer Banks. Expanding beyond their hometown, they sold out U.S. shows, supported Louis Tomlinson, toured Europe with Inhaler, and headlined their first North American tour in fall 2022, selling over 15,000 tickets. In spring 2023, Sun Room toured North America with Inhaler before returning to SoCal to finish At Least I Tried, which earned widespread acclaim.\n\nIn summer 2025, Sun Room released their latest EP, Ritual of Chaos, before supporting Flipturn and embarking on a 20+ date headline tour. The project showcases the band\u2019s love of blues-rock, shoegaze and post-punk garage influences absorbed from playing worldwide. Their live show channels the energy of their early San Diego house shows - bigger and more electrifying with every performance.\n\nSun Room continues to push their sound, explore new cities, and draw inspiration from their experiences. Their highly anticipated debut album is set for release in early 2026.",

They\u2019ve made a box big enough to hold post-punk, grunge, college rock, shoegaze, and post-hardcore, and Sunforger is still firmly outside it. Their effortless uniqueness is built on rhythmic and percussive guitars, infinitely repeatable cadences, and emotive hypnagogia. The name Sunforger is spoken with reverence in DIY circles across North America, disseminated over half a decade of Bandcamp deep-diving, touring, festivals, a self-titled album, and a 7-minute EP. Sunforger\u2019s eagerly awaited second album, entitled Weight, arrives May 2026 via the labels Cooked Raw and Julia\u2019s War.",

    "description": "Sunshine Spazz is a garage rock power trio with hints of punk and blues from Ocean County, New Jersey. Ryan Rutter (guitar/vocals) and Michael Rutter (bass) are brothers by blood, and that can be felt in the music as they battle for their tones to be heard, whether the fuzzy bass prevails or the reverberating, delayed guitar grabs your sonic sensations. Jamie Lawler (drums) is the glue of the band, as well as the moderator that keeps The Rutter Brothers from turning the musical space into a combat ring.\nSunshine Spazz's self-titled debut album released in November of 2023, and allowed them to complete two interstate runs, as well as the opportunity to play Asbury Park's Sea.Hear.Now Festival in September of 2024 alongside acts like Bruce Springsteen, Action Bronson, The Gaslight Anthem, Illiterate Light, and many more. With singles to be released in fall and winter of 2025, and an album release in January 2026, the three boys bonded by rock will be hitting the road much more. Their new album packs a punch that is a beautiful release in dealing with grief. After losing a very dear friend, Sunshine Spazz has transformed this project into a creative coping mechanism and a tribute that reflects the depth of their bond that once was. It goes to show that what seemingly ends, actually continues energetically.",

    "description": "Composing and producing in his Los Angeles living room from age 11, Flanagan cites his earliest musical experiences as piano recitals attended by Hollywood directors and Weezer\u2019s frontman, who Flanagan remembers \u201ccommenting on my rhythmic sensibility\u201d by pointing at his foot tapping to keep time during his first performance. Flanagan began circulating studios filled with aspiring millennial producers in his teens, informed by an orchestral background fueled by public school music programs in which he played both upright bass and violin. It was then that he taught himself to use DAWs and the rules of \u201cheavily-produced\u201d pop music.\n\nFlanagan found success during the pandemic under his first name, \u2018KALI\u2019. His initial releases garnered the appearance of a budding career as an indie-pop star, with millions of streams and collaborations with seasoned high-profile producers and industry teams. Despite the upward mobility, Flanagan\u2019s growing interpersonal dysphoria was easily a metaphor for his dissatisfaction with his artistic output and community as he reached adulthood. Growing up in Los Angeles was contingent on this ever-present new wave of pop music oblivion; \u201chits\u201d made in 5-hour sessions with strangers, a social life suffocated by others\u2019 aspirations for fame, and an absent audience for live music that pushed past the prescriptions of recorded music. Following his physical transition (to become male), his three-word synth pop hooks were swapped out for stanzas describing dissociation and gender envy, soundtracked by a now-signature, deeply tuned acoustic guitar.\n\nFlanagan\u2019s pared-down playing style and vocal have drawn comparisons to songwriters as Kurt Cobain, Leonard Cohen and Nick Drake. He has held monthly residencies at the now-defunct Los Angeles staple Genghis Cohen, (which drew the attendance of Julian Casablancas) and New York\u2019s Pete\u2019s Candy Store. Superfan has since played shows with the likes of Jordan Patterson (with whom both Flanagan and Almassi are frequent contributors), Quiet Light, untitled (halo), Autobahn, Horsegirl, Userband, as well as in the UK & Europe alongside acts such as Tiberius B and Samba Jean Baptiste. He is booked for shows with Kelora, Knifeplay, Dan English, and Kath Bloom in the fall. Flanagan is a member of the rising NYC emo band, Holidays in United States, who is in the process of recording a full-length project. Additional contributions as a multi-instrumentalist will be found on Jordan Patterson\u2019s upcoming debut, \u201cThe Hermit\u201d. Kali is currently a student at Hunter College studying Anthropology and writing as a freelancer for the artist-favorite Creative Independent.",

She has composed and produced original music for theater, dance, and film/TV, working across genres from contemporary classical to electronic, hip-hop, and pop, with artists like D-Smoke, Teyana Taylor, FAVE and many more - earning recognition for her boundary-pushing artistry and emotional depth.\n\nHer debut album, Dark Therapy, pushes post-classical music into avant-garde electronic and cinematic realms, inviting listeners into a space of introspection, healing, and sensory immersion.",

    "description": "t-low is one of the most distinctive voices of the new German music generation. With a raw emotional honesty and a sound rooted in emo rap and alternative pop, he has become a defining figure in the post-Gen-Z youth culture of the German-speaking world. Born and raised in a small town in northern Germany, t-low emerged from SoundCloud culture and quickly gained nationwide attention with his unfiltered lyrics and melodic sensibility. His music explores themes of mental health, love, identity, and existential struggle delivered with a rare vulnerability that resonates deeply with his audience.\n\nWith multiple gold and platinum records, sold-out tours, and chart-topping singles, t-low has established himself as a generational voice in Germany. Yet despite his commercial success, he has consistently pushed boundaries and stayed artistically uncompromising. In late 2025, t-low will release his highly anticipated comeback album \"REAL MUSIC\", marking a return to his roots with a more introspective, emotionally complex sound. His showcase at SXSW 2026 is not about breaking into the U.S. market - it\u2019s a statement.",

    "description": "For the past 10 years, Theo Lawrence has been making a name for himself as France's favorite songbird. A truly one-of-a-kind country singer and genuine keeper of the flame, Lawrence came into his own on his Austin-made 2023 LP release, Cherie, and on his all-acoustic album, Pickin' & Singin'. His most recent release, a duet All Fifty States (with Melissa Carper), is a playful back-and-forth about two people in love who don\u2019t always see eye to eye. It's a perfect showcase of storytelling, connection, and the artistry Theo brings to every song.\n\nLawrence pens classic love songs and delivers with a croon straight out of the Charlie Rich and Ray Price golden years. In recent years, he has played a pivotal role in reviving an interest for Country Music in Europe, and with his recent move to Austin, TX, Theo Lawrence is bringing his honed craft back to its American cradle.\n\nNewly signed to Warner Records, we expect to hear Theo's name a lot more in the coming months and years.",

During this time, she recorded an impressive four mixtapes, each containing 20 songs, showcasing her resilience and dedication to her craft. Despite the hardships she faced, Tia emerged stronger, using her artistry as a means of empowerment and self-expression.

    "description": "Come Back Down, the new album by Nashville experimental-pop duo Total Wife, was born from the edge of sleep. When composer and producer Luna Kupper would begin to fall asleep during late-night mixing sessions, the songs would follow her into the halfway place between dream and lucidity. Like Dale Cooper in Twin Peaks, she\u2019d wake with a new perspective on the puzzle she was piecing together. \u201cI\u2019m a psychological mixer \u2014 I\u2019m trying to think of how someone\u2019s experiencing the sound, versus getting stuck in trying to make all these different tones and using all this gear to make something sound a certain way,\u201d Kupper says.\n\nAnd like a spiral from waking life into dream, the songs on Come Back Down are endlessly self- referential, building whole universes from a single point. Kupper sold all of her synths to make rent before she started working on the album, and so every inorganic sound is instead built from samples of the band\u2019s own work. A guitar on one song may be reprocessed and used as a synth on the next, while everywhere on the album vocal samples are taken from a single unreleased cover of Elliott Smith\u2019s \u201cBetween the Bars.\u201d In tribute to this process, the album was almost named The Julia Set after the mathematical equation which feeds into itself again and again, creating beautiful fractal images. The intention was to create something complex but accessible; experimental, yet precise and without abstraction.",

    "description": "True Jackson is an independent artist who blends 90s grunge rock production with an anthemic pop vocal. A native of Los Angeles, True has been embraced by the vibrant New York music scene, having performed at such legendary venues as the Mercury Lounge, Baby\u2019s All Right, and Le Poisson Rouge, to name a few.\nTrue channels her emotions into catchy hooks and electrifying guitar riffs, painting a clear picture of where she has been and where she\u2019s going with her debut song: \u201cPaint Me\u201d, released in 2024 and featured in the American High film, 'Prom Dates', streaming on Hulu.\nTrue\u2019s debut EP, RIP TRUE, was released in 2025 and features standouts \u201cSmooth Talking\u201d and \u201cBad\u201d. Making music for the crashout girlies, these 4 songs encapsulate struggling with self-doubt and navigating out of her youth into her 20\u2019s, allowing the audience to scream and dance through life, embracing the imperfections instead of sitting in it.\nHer follow-up project explores a toxic relationship and how the heroine ultimately regains her power. The project will be released in Spring 2026 with two lead singles coming just before she takes Austin, TX by storm as part of this year\u2019s South by Southwest Festival.",

    "description": "The amalgamation of four distinct voices from Adelaide, The Tullamarines tell their stories through a shared perspective that feels intimate, honest, and quietly uplifting. Josh, Angus, Benny and Lucinda met on the local gig circuit, quickly bonding over a mutual love of songwriting and collaboration. From those early connections, they\u2019ve crafted a sound that reflects each member\u2019s individual sensibilities - a style they affectionately call cosy-pop.\n\nTheir songs move through life\u2019s highs and lows with the warmth of an old friend, inviting listeners into their living room, putting the kettle on, and sitting with whatever feeling the day brings. That sense of closeness runs through both their recorded work and their live shows.\n\nHaving appeared on festival line-ups including Beyond The Valley, Laneway Festival, Spin Off Festival and New Year\u2019s Eve on the Hill, and toured extensively alongside artists such as Old Mervs, The Preatures, Ball Park Music and Alex Lahey, The Tullamarines continue to build a reputation for heartfelt songwriting and deeply human performances.",

    "description": "A post-punk project out of Brooklyn NY, Two-Man Giant Squid has earned acclaim in the New York City underground for their ability to fuse dance-punk, garage, and psych influences into fierce live shows and ambitious recordings (KEXP, SPIN). They lean on an eclectic mix to produce their sound including matter-of-fact vocal delivery, intricate synth design, and lately- a theremin. Their most recent LP was unveiled at last year\u2019s SXSW festival and later charted at #89 on National Indie Radio charts. With a slate of releases & tours planned for 2026, Two-Man Giant Squid brings their signature creativity and DIY spirit to the forefront of the post-punk revival.",

    "description": "Unsafe Space Garden is a genre-bending outfit from Portugal known for their chaotic, theatrical and deeply immersive live shows. With a sound rooted in neo-psychedelia, experimental rock and a touch of surreal humour, the band pushes musical boundaries with fearless creativity and a clear artistic vision.\n\nDescribed by European press as \u201ca surrealist orchestra,\u201d their concerts often blur the line between performance and ritual - unpredictable, cathartic and strangely uplifting. Their critically acclaimed albums Bro, You Got Something In Your Eye \u2013 A Guided Meditation (2021) and Where\u2019s The Ground? (2023) draw comparisons to artists like Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart or The Flaming Lips, while forging a language uniquely their own.\n\nMore than just experimentalists, Unsafe Space Garden are storytellers - unpredictable, emotional and sonically adventurous.

    "description": "Valee is a Chicago-born rapper known for his minimalist delivery, deadpan charisma, and hypnotic approach to trap and street rap. Emerging from the city\u2019s underground, he broke through with cult-favorite records like Womp Womp and Good Job, You Found Me, later releasing projects via Kanye West\u2019s GOOD Music before continuing independently. Valee\u2019s sound is defined by sparse beats, unconventional flows, and an anti-performative cool that has influenced a wave of modern rap aesthetics. He\u2019s collaborated and shared stages with artists across the experimental and mainstream rap spectrum, earning a reputation as a tastemaker\u2019s rapper with lasting cultural impact rather than trend-chasing appeal.",

    "description": "Victor Jones has taken off tremendously in the past year and change, hitting a over million streams on spotify in 2025 alone, with success on tracks such as Mother Teresa and I Get Hurt boosted by strong short form social media campaigns. Victor comes from a background of comedy and theater as much as music, and it shows through even (especially?) in his darkest songs.\n\nVictor plays with a modular backing band consisting of 1-2 people and carefully arranged backing tracks. His shows are high energy, danceable, and chantable. He prides himself on having, at least in the past year, made people cry at every show, and alternately, made them dance.",

    "description": "Victoryland is the Brooklyn-based project of musician Julian McCamman. His label-debut, My Heart Is A Room With No Cameras In It, out January 23, 2026 via Good English, is a triumphant, despondent, and ultimately fun experimental pop-rock album. Victoryland started in Philly 2023 with the release of tape, Sprain, which echoed more of what the Philly scene was dishing out: lo-fi, tape-recorded rock with a capital R. It was the collaborative efforts of producer Dan Howard that brought the new vision and sound into full focus.Dan and Julian previously worked on Julian\u2019s now-defunct Texas-to-Philly based band, Blood\u2019s Loving You Backwards LP, a collaborative effort between six bandmates. That experience pushed Julian toward a more personal process of recording, starting with home demos and then bringing them to Dan to shape into songs. This relationship ultimately led Julian to move to NYC.\n\nThe sound of the album, recorded between Julian\u2019s Bed Stuy basement and Dan\u2019s Williamsburg studio, is the sound of a bright and beaming collaboration. Landing somewhere between lo-fi and hi-fi production, the songs have the glossiness of a radio-friendly hit mixed with the distortion and rough edges of a home demo. Every song keeps at least one element of the initial recording, while building around the loops and half-songs Julian scrapped together. The lyrics on the record span from humorous self-aware popisms (\u201c\u2018you and I\u2019 will soon be, used to be \u2018us\u2019\u201d) to crushing realities of bitterness(\u201ci\u2019ll never forgive you, that\u2019s how I keep you close\u201d) to abstract imagery (\u201cmothers wave from doorways, in ostinato\u201d), all delivered with such an immediacy and fervor that in the middle of singing along, you wonder if this guy slept much last night.\n\nMy Heart wrangles with heavy subject matter (love, disconnection, sexual frustration, emptiness etc.), but the terminal statement of the record is about the cleansing nature of pop music. That, if a song can force you to \u201cbliss out\u201d over a hook or a loop, or even make you dance, it can be the spoonful of sugar to swallow the hard pill with; this is what Victoryland strives to do: package the most exhausting realities of life, love, and the search for connection in a world starved of it, into a fun 2-5 minutes, and for the runtime of Victoryland\u2019s first major statement, you might even feel like you\u2019re not alone.",

Austin based rapper and DJ has risen up to speak for a section of Austin that has rarely had a voice. Blending tales from the streets with very poignant bars of consciousness and social reform. Vintage Jay was featured on KUTX radio September Artist of the month and KUTX Summer Jam. Making him an official NPR Session artist. The city of Austin has also given Jay his official proclamation date September 12th. From producing cultural and musical events to as well expressing his life through music. Jay has become an individual of many traits, his latest album Still I Rise, speaks of a new age of creativity and musical expression to the ear. His growth in his music is something that appears in every album, and one thing that never changes is that he stays true to himself and the craft. Jay has become a true tastemaker and one of the biggest Latino figures in Austin, TX. To represent the Latino culture with pride and honor is something Jay has done since day 1.",

    "description": "VUKOVI are a dynamic two-piece alt-rock outfit from Scotland fronted by vocalist Janine Shilstone and guitarist Hamish Reilly. Their sound combines blistering riffs and melodic vocals with elements of heavy-rock, noise-pop, and nu-metal, suitable for fans of Bring Me The Horizon, PVRIS, Don Broco and Rage Against The Machine. Following the critical success of their 2017 debut (\u2018VUKOVI\u2019) and the electrifying follow-up \u2018Fall Better\u2019 (2020), VUKOVI truly ascended to stratospheric new heights with their third album, \u2018NULA\u2019 (2022). While \u2018La Di Da\u2019, drawn from their debut, remains a perennial fan favourite, tracks such as \u2018LASSO\u2019, \u2018HADES\u2019 and the anthemic \u2018I EXIST\u2019 continue to command chaos from fans in live settings across the globe. VUKOVI released their latest album \u2018MY GOD HAS GOT A GUN\u2019 via Sharptone Records in 2025, recorded and co-produced by legendary Machine at The Machine Shop Studio in Texas. The album garnered praise for its cathartic yet exorcistic expression of themes surrounding mental health, religion and female empowerment.\nHaving toured with the likes of Babymetal, Enter Shikari, PVRIS, Nothing More and One Ok Rock, VUKOVI continue to build their audiences worldwide.",

    "description": "Wacotron is a Texas trap artist from Waco, Texas, delivering high impact records rooted in authenticity, pressure, and precision. Built from the ground up, his rise reflects a disciplined approach to music, pairing raw street perspective with elite level production and proven performance metrics.\n\nAfter building organic traction online, Wacotron\u2019s momentum accelerated through his affiliation with Pick Six Records, where his sound sharpened and his reach expanded. His breakout phase was defined by collaborations with producers from the 808 Mafia camp, resulting in hard hitting releases that generated millions of views and streams across digital platforms. These records didn\u2019t just circulate, they converted, placing Wacotron in front of a national audience and solidifying his market viability.\n\nAnchored by dark, bass driven production and a commanding delivery, Wacotron\u2019s catalog speaks directly to trap culture while maintaining crossover appeal. His visuals and singles consistently perform at scale across YouTube and streaming services, reflecting a growing fanbase and long term positioning in today\u2019s dominant trap landscape.",

    "description": "\u201cArguably the most exciting rock band to emerge from the American experimental underground this decade.\u201d - Grayson Haver Currin, MOJO Magazine 2025\n\nDrones are a powerful force, capable of whisking our thinking mind far, far, away. Austin-based collective Water Damage yields the same power whenever they pick up their instruments. Veterans from other projects (a.o. Swans, more eaze, Spray Paint, USA/Mexico and more), the band is not unfamiliar with the unshakeable power in drones; still, as Water Damage, they stretch out drone\u2019s possibilities to their limits, bowing to the principle \u2018Maximal Repetition Minimal Deviation\u2019. Water Damage explore ecstatic oblivion, repeating basic riffs and rhythms until time seems to falter. Once an idea takes off, they pursue it forever; as Pitchfork said, their 2024 double LP \u2018In E\u2019 doubles as a \u201cglorious mind eraser\u201d.",

    "description": "Werkha (aka Tom Leah) is a multi-instrumentalist, producer & DJ hailing from Manchester and Cumbria. He has been consistently releasing music and creating live experiences for over a decade. Werkha\u2019s music fuses analogue jazz-funk vibes with the UK\u2019s electronic, resulting in a number of releases nestled between the sounds of broken beat and cinematic moments. Deep synths and delectable drums ride alongside live horns and a wealth of string textures. Shortly after his track \u201cSidesteppin\u201d was picked up by Gilles Peterson for his Brownswood Bubblers compilation, Werkha\u2019s debut landed on the acclaimed Brighton imprint Tru Thoughts. He went on to sign to the Worldwide Award-winning First Word Records, releasing his self-produced sophomore album \u2018All Werk Is Play\u2019 in 2022. This featured collabs with MC Chunky (Eglo Records / Swamp 81), Ellen Beth Abdi (A Certain Ratio), Kemani Anderson (Secret Night Gang), Nick Blacka (GoGo Penguin) and Tom Driessler (Tom Misch / Jordan Rakei) amongst others.\n\nHis vibrant energetic live shows include a selection of instruments, looped and fused with a mix of tightly packed samples that set the moment alight, blending beauty and dance.",

    "description": "Featuring five musicians who grew up in El Paso, Lubbock and Amarillo, the West Texas Exiles draw upon the wide-open western reaches of the Lone Star State with a wide-ranging, Americana-centered sound. Rising from the embers of the Dirty River Boys, which Marco Gutierrez co-founded in 2009, the Austin band features a triple-threat of songwriters in Gutierrez, Daniel Davis and Colin Gilmore (son of legendary Texas troubadour Jimmie Dale Gilmore), plus seasoned bassist/producer Eric Harrison and latter-day Dirty River Boys drummer Trinidad Leal. The Exiles' 2023 debut EP paved the way for their first full-length album,\u00a08000 Days. Since its September release the album has steadily risen to #8 on the Americana radio charts and has drawn critical praise. The recordings build upon the live chops the group has honed through a weekly residency at Austin\u2019s legendary Continental Club plus gigs at key local events such as SXSW and Willie Nelson\u2019s Luck Reunion, as well as high-profile touring appearances at Nashville\u2019s Americanafest, Braun Brothers Reunion and San Francisco\u2019s Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival.",

    "description": "Originally inspired by a Slowdive KEXP session, London-based quartet Whitelands fuse their diverse musical backgrounds into an updated spin on shoegaze that amplifies marginalized voices and perspectives. Formed in the late 2010s as the solo project of Etienne Quartey-Papafio, Whitelands evolved into a full band ahead of their official debut album, Night-Bound Eyes Are Blind to the Day (2024), released during a U.K. tour with Slowdive. The project takes its name from a campus at London\u2019s Roehampton University, where Quartey-Papafio first performed live. Their self-titled 2018 debut, a lo-fi blend of jagged indie rock and hazy grunge textures, hinted at the immersive sound they would later embrace. A turning point came when Quartey-Papafio stumbled upon Slowdive\u2019s 2017 KEXP performance, igniting a deeper fixation on shoegaze. The current lineup consists of Jagun Meseorisa, Vanessa Govinden, and Michael Adelaja who bonded through shared experiences of neurodivergence and racial identity. Whitelands\u2019 forthcoming album, Sunlight Echoes (out January 30, 2026), expands their sound, moving beyond shoegaze\u2019s shadows toward something bigger, brighter, and unmistakably their own.",

    "description": "Jersey-born Maria Crawford has been paving her way through the Nashville independent music scene since 2014. Now Brooklyn-based, she continues to capture listeners with her fiercely vulnerable songwriting and compelling live performances. Wilby\u2019s debut single \u201cBad\u201d (2020) gained immediate attention, followed by \"Translucent Beauty\u201d (2021), drifting between bedroom pop and indie rock. Her sophomore EP, \u201cHappiest Woman\u201d (2023), marked a shift toward showcasing a full-band production, mirroring the force of Wilby\u2019s live sound. Wilby\u2019s debut album, \u201cCenter of Affection\u201d (2025, via Hit the North Records), explores both the cathartic side of indie-rock and the vulnerable side of twangy folk. Wilby has been featured in FLOOD Magazine, Luna Collective, and Ones To Watch, named an Artist to Watch by Atwood Magazine, with support from Seattle\u2019s KEXP and Nashville\u2019s WNXP and Lightning 100.",

    "description": "Willgood has now been DJing long enough that the original plan to fund a nationwide automotive repainting initiative exclusively in red has been officially downgraded from \u201cambitious\u201d to \u201csymbolic.\u201d What started as a financial experiment became a long-term commitment to dance floors, tasteful grooves, and basslines that behave like they know what they\u2019re doing.\n\nStill operating without formal mentorship (DJ Pagliacci remains legally unreachable), Willgood approaches DJing as a serious craft with unserious presentation favoring disco, house, and dance music that sneaks up on you, locks in, and refuses to rush. Still has the long term goal of being the 4th member of Being Dead. He loves Ferraris, not because they\u2019re fast, but because they\u2019re precise, opinionated, and allergic to subtlety.\n\nThe hat is gone. The red remains. Catch Willgood at SXSW doing what he does best: keeping it fun, keeping it moving, and quietly convincing you this was always the plan.",

On her latest track, EARMILK writes \u201c\u201cOUCHIE\u201d defies easy categorization, blending synth-pop, raw punk attitude, and alt-rock vibes into a shifting, avant-garde sound.\u201d\n\nWilloh\u2019s self-produced 20205 debut, not more than that, but more please presents us with a raw honesty rendered through snowy vocals that sit in rarefied air and belies the artist\u2019s 19 years. In September she released the labyrinthine \u201cBuckshot\u201d to critical acclaim.\n\nFrom her home in Springfield, Missouri, willoh records and creates music, having first found her footing on Garageband before graduating to LogicPro\u2013making the upgrade from her earnings working many long shifts at McDonalds.",

    "description": "Based in Athens, Georgia, Wim Tapley came of age playing venues in Washington D.C. and its sprawling suburbs. There, he honed his voice with the passion of a born troubadour, drawing in a diverse fanbase with his easy showmanship and distinct style.\n\nSince 2021, Athens has been home to Wim and his live band The Cannons. His first week in town, Wim made his way onto a local bill, etching a name for himself as a fresh and favorite hometown voice. He is ardently received by his ever-growing following at legendary regional venues like the 9:30 Club, Eddie\u2019s Attic, and the Georgia Theatre\u2014the latter of which he\u2019s sold out more than once\u2014and on tours across the country.\n\nFirmly rooted in Americana and dashed with glamorous pop sensibilities, the swinging depths of neo-soul, and a sprinkling of riotous horns, Wim\u2019s arresting sound is as fresh as it is ageless, as fevered as it is raucous fun.\n\nA sonic westward expansion of fuzzed-out guitars, defiant horns, and dusty vocals, his discography blazes a fresh new take on folk-pop while honoring the songwriting giants that paved the way before him like Jason Isbell, Bill Withers, and Chris Stapleton.",

    "description": "YARD are the electrifying three-piece electropunk band from Dublin. Known for their intense and immersive live shows, YARD bridges the gap between electronica and post-punk, creating an auditory onslaught that leaves audiences sweaty, energised, and strangely unnerved.\n\nSince their inception, YARD has shared stages with the likes of A Place To Bury Strangers, Psychotic Monks and Mandy Indiana. Their electrifying live performances, akin to Death Grips, Nine Inch Nails and The Prodigy, have earned them coveted slots at festivals such as Les Transmusicales, Haldern Pop and Into The Great Wide Open.\n\nWith a recent live performance on KEXP, continued support from Rolling Stone, BBC Radio 6, Clash and Louder Than War among others and two self-titled EPs under their belt, YARD are set to continue their meteoric rise in 2026.\n\nA recent live review captured the YARD experience perfectly: \u201cIn their presence, you see and feel them painstakingly crafting every note and sound with their bare hands, wrestling with different sockets, switches, strings, or even their voices. The venue was transformed into this factory of raw, unadulterated noise which kept us all at the mercy of the sound - collectively banging our heads in synchronicity.\u201d",

    "description": "Born amidst the cultural vibrancy of Glasgow and Paris, YES AND MAYBE is an electrifying two-piece band that pushes the boundaries of contemporary music.\n\nThe first band member, a multi-instrumentalist and writer, excels in crafting minimalist guitar-based melodies, demonstrating a perfect blend of ingenuity and precision. His obsessive self-criticism and penchant for perfection have allowed him to transform his influences into his own unique sound.\n\nThe second member, a performer, writer, and producer, brings his experiences and emotions to life through introspective lyrics paired with evocative, ethereal vocals. His artistry lies in balancing deeply metaphorical, grounded lyrics with melodies that evoke a sense of escapism. This potent mix of realism and fantasy forms an integral part of YES AND MAYBE's distinctive sound.\n\u200b\nTheir songwriting process, both organic and instinctive, evolves from a simple phrase or a recorded sound into a comprehensive musical piece within a day. Their songs encapsulate their raw emotions, serving as a beacon of authenticity in an industry often mired in overproduction.\n\nYES AND MAYBE, though relatively new, brings a refreshing spontaneity and a shared vision to redefine the musical landscape. Their commitment to creating music that resonates with their listeners' shared experiences makes them a band worth investing in. Keep an eye on this Glasgow based duo\u2014they're a unique proposition with a future as innovative as their sound.",

Her commitment to uplifting women in music led to the creation of Queendomfest, Southeast Asia\u2019s first all-female music festival.\n\nIn 2025, Zamaera became the fourth Malaysian artist to perform at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Building on that momentum, she now presents the first-ever dedicated national showcase, Made In Malaysia, at SXSW 2026, featuring an all-Malaysian lineup.\n\nHer latest single, Ikan Kekek, released in February 2026, reimagines a traditional Malay folklore rhyme through trap and techno textures, exploring cultural memory, artistic freedom, and non-linear expression.",

    "description": "The Bantu & Boundless artist, Zola Marcelle, is a Zimbabwean-born, London-based multidisciplinary artist. With a rare mix of Shona and Sotho heritage, her journey through music, culture, and history is steadily shaping her into an exciting contemporary voice of her generation. Raised partially in Bulawayo with a family steeped in music, Zola grew up with a deep connection to song and her African roots.\n\nBelonging to a generation of active participants in Zimbabwe\u2019s independence struggle, Zola adopted a profound sense of responsibility, identity, and freedom. Having grown up in a home where music was a staple diet, Zola was surrounded by the global sounds of legends like Sankomota, Andrae Crouch, Stevie Wonder, Jimmy Dludlu and Sibongile Khumalo. When she wasn\u2019t listening to these musical greats, Zola would accompany her father on photography outings, a combination of visual and sonic inspiration that would later fuel her own creative process. These early experiences gave her a foundation in both artistry and activism.",
